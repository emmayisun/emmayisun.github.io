We make good progress getting inflation rate down from the from the unbearable peaks that it had reached.</span> <span id="sentence-14" data-timestamp="01:13" class="dovish">And we did that without a recession, which was virtually unheard of.</span> <span id="sentence-15" data-timestamp="01:18" class="hawkish bold">And now at the start of this year, we've gotten multiple inflation readings that are higher than where we wanted them to be.</span> <span id="sentence-16" data-timestamp="01:25" class="neutral">And I always say one month is no months, but two months.</span> <span id="sentence-17" data-timestamp="01:28" class="hawkish bold">You got yourself a real month and now we got two to three months of CPI inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-18" data-timestamp="01:33" class="neutral">We'll see what happens on PCE inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-19" data-timestamp="01:36" class="hawkish bold">But we must get inflation back down to target.</span> <span id="sentence-20" data-timestamp="01:39" class="neutral">The law says that we need to maximize employment to stabilize prices.</span> <span id="sentence-21" data-timestamp="01:44" class="neutral">That's the dual mandate and if we're not getting the job done, we have to get the job.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-22" data-timestamp="01:50" class="neutral">Neil: We're told that PCE that personal consumers part of is a favorite of you and your fellow fed and that generally might show not all the time more stable inflation environment if it does, are we back to the consensus that had built for at least two rate cuts?</span> <span id="sentence-23" data-timestamp="02:06" class="neutral">Some are looking at three rate cuts or is that also a jump ball?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-24" data-timestamp="02:12" class="neutral">Goolsbee: Well, I don't like tying our hands to say what we're going to do and future meetings.</span> <span id="sentence-25" data-timestamp="02:17" class="neutral bold">I don't even like doing that for the upcoming meeting when we're still going to get a bunch of data between now and then much less for these meeting.</span> <span id="sentence-26" data-timestamp="02:23" class="neutral">What are you going to do in June and September and and at the end of the year.</span> <span id="sentence-27" data-timestamp="02:28" class="dovish">Now that said it's clear if you take the long arc on inflation, that we were at real highs, and that it has come way down from those highs.</span> <span id="sentence-28" data-timestamp="02:36" class="neutral bold">And if we start getting readings from the PCE inflation, which is the better measure and that's why the Fed mostly looks at that and that's what the target is on.</span> <span id="sentence-29" data-timestamp="02:45" class="dovish bold">If we start getting better readings that show us that that arc of inflation coming down is true. That will make us feel a lot better about where we are in terms of monetary policy environment.</span> <span id="sentence-30" data-timestamp="02:58" class="hawkish bold">If the PCE inflation is re reinflating, then like I say our job is stabilized prices and we will stabilize the prices</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-31" data-timestamp="03:07" class="neutral">Neil: which means you will not be cutting.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-32" data-timestamp="03:10" class="neutral">Goolsbee: I'm not gonna I'm not gonna commit to what the policy could be.</span> <span id="sentence-33" data-timestamp="03:14" class="neutral">Let's just look at the numbers.</span> <span id="sentence-34" data-timestamp="03:16" class="neutral">You know, the parent of the data dog caucus is is the is the one I like to be part of and we just got to get the numbers.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-35" data-timestamp="03:23" class="neutral">Neil: Okay.</span> <span id="sentence-36" data-timestamp="03:24" class="neutral">I was hoping to get you on a weak moment.</span> <span id="sentence-37" data-timestamp="03:26" class="neutral">Let me get serious and so I'll spend about the soft landing argument Are you confident that that that can still happen?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-38" data-timestamp="03:38" class="dovish">Goolsbee: I kept using the phrase the golden path for 2023 that it was the mother of all the soft landings that you could get inflation down without a big recession.</span> <span id="sentence-39" data-timestamp="03:48" class="dovish">And in 2023, we did that.</span> <span id="sentence-40" data-timestamp="03:51" class="neutral">Now this question of the last mile is a little harder.</span> <span id="sentence-41" data-timestamp="03:55" class="hawkish">We're not going to have as much of the beneficial supply developments that we had in 2023 as we go into 2024 and we're still dealing with this question of how persistent is the inflation?</span> <span id="sentence-42" data-timestamp="04:07" class="hawkish bold">For me, the most important number to be watching on the inflation front here in the immediate term is what is happening with housing inflation, which if you go into the components of core inflation, this housing we thought by now would be coming down.</span> <span id="sentence-43" data-timestamp="04:22" class="dovish">If you look at market rents, they have come down the inflation rate there has come down, but that has not yet showed up as we thought it would in the broader measures of inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-44" data-timestamp="04:33" class="hawkish bold">And if it does. housing costs in general, it's under the real estate market, housing costs in general, but it's what it's kind of a specific measure of housing costs, which is based on what the rental prices are an owner occupied rent equivalent.</span> <span id="sentence-45" data-timestamp="04:50" class="hawkish bold">If that doesn't go down to something like what it was pre COVID will have a hard time getting the overall back to target.</span> <span id="sentence-46" data-timestamp="04:58" class="neutral">So I that's something everybody we're a long way from.</span> <span id="sentence-47" data-timestamp="05:01" class="neutral">We're a long way from there a long way.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-48" data-timestamp="05:05" class="neutral">Neil: So let me step back.</span> <span id="sentence-49" data-timestamp="05:07" class="neutral">And get your sense then.</span> <span id="sentence-50" data-timestamp="05:08" class="neutral">The conundrum the Fed could be in because obviously, you don't want to keep this going on with with rates where they are, God forbid higher because the flip side of that is the soft landing you hope to get doesn't materialize and that you could throw the whole country into a recession.</span> <span id="sentence-51" data-timestamp="05:23" class="neutral">If you erred on the side of hiking rather than cutting.</span> <span id="sentence-52" data-timestamp="05:26" class="neutral">How do you weigh that?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-53" data-timestamp="05:30" class="neutral">Goolsbee: What look, this is why every central banker in the United States and around the world goes to sleep each night with indigestion is you got to you got to balance those things off.</span> <span id="sentence-54" data-timestamp="05:41" class="neutral bold">The way to square the circle, I think is we're mostly gonna just follow the data and see what happens.</span> <span id="sentence-55" data-timestamp="05:47" class="neutral">The law gives us the dual mandate.</span> <span id="sentence-56" data-timestamp="05:49" class="dovish bold">And if we're getting inflation down, then the real rate the the rate that we set minus the inflation rate, which is kind of a level of restrictiveness.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-57" data-timestamp="06:03" class="dovish bold">Even if you're holding the rate steady as inflation falls, you're tightening the restrictiveness.</span> <span id="sentence-58" data-timestamp="06:10" class="dovish bold">So if we see that inflation is on this path back down to 2%. Then we got to think do we want to remain as restrictive as we are right now for for a long period.</span> <span id="sentence-59" data-timestamp="06:21" class="hawkish bold">If inflation doesn't come down, then the the that answer is that for us. I mean, we have to get inflation down.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-60" data-timestamp="06:30" class="neutral">Neil: You can't control oil prices.</span> <span id="sentence-61" data-timestamp="06:32" class="hawkish bold">And they're the web admin spiking largely on some of this recent instability in the Middle East. So that's a wildcard for you right?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-62" data-timestamp="06:41" class="hawkish">Goolsbee: That's definitely a wildcard on two counts.</span> <span id="sentence-63" data-timestamp="06:44" class="hawkish bold">One is the price of oil and the price of gasoline go into the cost of living so for headline inflation, that goes in there, but it's a wild card on the second dimension, which is when the price of oil goes up.</span> <span id="sentence-64" data-timestamp="06:58" class="hawkish bold">That's a key component to the production of a whole bunch of things, and from FedEx drivers to manufacturing to et cetera.</span> <span id="sentence-65" data-timestamp="07:05" class="hawkish">And so that's a negative supply shock and we've seen over the decades what happens when you get negative supply shocks hitting the economy is not good.</span> <span id="sentence-66" data-timestamp="07:15" class="hawkish">It leads to more stagflation airy environment, so we're going to have to definitely keep an eye on commodity prices.</span> <span id="sentence-67" data-timestamp="07:22" class="neutral">In the meantime, we are in a presidential election year I think because we have all these fancy graphics here, Austin and special music.</span> <span id="sentence-68" data-timestamp="07:30" class="neutral">And I'm just wondering if Donald Trump got back into the Oval Office, he's made it clear he's no fan of Jerome Powell.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-69" data-timestamp="07:37" class="neutral">Neil: So he replaced him.</span> <span id="sentence-70" data-timestamp="07:39" class="neutral">What do you think of that?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-71" data-timestamp="07:42" class="neutral">Goolsbee: Well, when I became a Fed man, I stopped talking about elections and politics and partisan battles of the old days.</span> <span id="sentence-72" data-timestamp="07:50" class="neutral">The feds job is to go off to conditions we got a dual mandate.</span> <span id="sentence-73" data-timestamp="07:55" class="neutral">There's nothing in there that says anything about politics about the stock market or any</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-74" data-timestamp="08:01" class="neutral">Neil: Are you saying that the Fed ignores saying the Fed ignores all of that though, because he needs to look put that pressure must be unbearable, because when you have many saying that, you know, Jerome Powell wants to make you know, this a little bit better for Joe Biden to be reelected.</span> <span id="sentence-75" data-timestamp="08:18" class="neutral">Not that he can orchestrate that at the Fed, but that is his personal preference.</span> <span id="sentence-76" data-timestamp="08:23" class="neutral">If he had his druthers, I don't even know if that's true, but that none of that enters into the equation with you guys.</span> <span id="sentence-77" data-timestamp="08:29" class="neutral">You don't.</span> <span id="sentence-78" data-timestamp="08:30" class="neutral">You don't sort of see what's going on around you.</span> <span id="sentence-79" data-timestamp="08:32" class="neutral">It's the big old elephant in the room.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-80" data-timestamp="08:35" class="neutral">Goolsbee: Like I said, I don't speak for I'm not gonna speak for Jay Powell you can go you should have an interview with with chair Powell.</span> <span id="sentence-81" data-timestamp="08:44" class="neutral">And you can ask him, I know that if you use specifically Austin goes we're not influenced by it.</span> <span id="sentence-82" data-timestamp="08:51" class="neutral">I don't have any pressure.</span> <span id="sentence-83" data-timestamp="08:53" class="neutral">Okay, and go just go look at the minutes or the transcripts of the FOMC meetings.</span> <span id="sentence-84" data-timestamp="08:58" class="neutral">We put those out publicly.</span> <span id="sentence-85" data-timestamp="09:00" class="neutral">Yeah.</span> <span id="sentence-86" data-timestamp="09:01" class="neutral">It's not about politics.</span> <span id="sentence-87" data-timestamp="09:03" class="neutral bold">It's about the dual mandate, what's in the employment and the job market and what's happening to prices.</span> <span id="sentence-88" data-timestamp="09:09" class="neutral">That's what's going to drive our behavior and because we got to tune out the arguments about elections, that's not appropriate in in the Fed context.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-90" data-timestamp="09:19" class="neutral">Neil: So you also tune out the markets you say and I've heard a lot of your colleagues say the same thing.</span> <span id="sentence-91" data-timestamp="09:24" class="neutral">You don't pay attention to it, but the markets were clearly expecting, you know, three rate cuts.</span> <span id="sentence-92" data-timestamp="09:30" class="neutral">Now they're down to two some are down to one I believe Bank of America is down to none.</span> <span id="sentence-93" data-timestamp="09:35" class="neutral">They don't think rate cuts this year.</span> <span id="sentence-94" data-timestamp="09:36" class="neutral">I don't you don't want to get into those predictions.</span> <span id="sentence-95" data-timestamp="09:39" class="neutral">But you know, what you say in that regard, is the type of stuff that that rattles them that's been rattling the market of late with this backup and inflation or the perception that it's not totally worked yet.</span> <span id="sentence-96" data-timestamp="09:53" class="neutral">So they're kind of losing hope.</span> <span id="sentence-97" data-timestamp="09:54" class="neutral">What do you tell them?</span> <span id="sentence-98" data-timestamp="09:56" class="neutral">Do you just ignore that?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-99" data-timestamp="09:59" class="neutral">Goolsbee: I don't want them to feel bad.</span> <span id="sentence-100" data-timestamp="10:01" class="neutral">But yeah, you mostly ignore them.</span> <span id="sentence-101" data-timestamp="10:03" class="neutral">The thing is, like I say the the law says what we're supposed to be watching, and it's employment and inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-102" data-timestamp="10:12" class="neutral">It doesn't say anything about the stock market.</span> <span id="sentence-103" data-timestamp="10:14" class="neutral">And when we put out a summary of economic projections, where we make contingent predictions of what will be the appropriate policy and each member of the FOMC is asked individually, we don't debate it, we don't deliver it.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-104" data-timestamp="10:31" class="neutral">Neil: What do you think the median of those at the at the last go round was for three cuts in this UI, right?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-105" data-timestamp="10:39" class="neutral">If you remember in December when we put it out the median of the FOMC said three cuts and the market immediately said well that must mean seven cuts so that's right.</span> <span id="sentence-106" data-timestamp="10:48" class="neutral">Part of me just can't ignore that you're gonna find out what you ignore that in the markets right?</span> <span id="sentence-107" data-timestamp="10:53" class="neutral">So you just you don't if it's down a few 100 points, I get it today.</span> <span id="sentence-108" data-timestamp="10:57" class="neutral">What that says all noise to you.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-109" data-timestamp="11:00" class="neutral">Goolsbee: I think that it's mostly noise.</span> <span id="sentence-110" data-timestamp="11:02" class="neutral">The thing to remember is financial conditions do affect the economy.</span> <span id="sentence-111" data-timestamp="11:07" class="neutral">They are like monetary policy, but only with a long lag.</span> <span id="sentence-112" data-timestamp="11:11" class="neutral">So what happens this week or next week?</span> <span id="sentence-113" data-timestamp="11:13" class="neutral">That's a part is noise.</span> <span id="sentence-114" data-timestamp="11:16" class="neutral">You can move what you're looking for is the longer live signal.</span></p>
