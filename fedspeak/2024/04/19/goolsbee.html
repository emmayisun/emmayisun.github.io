<p><b>Nick Timiraos:</b> <span id="sentence-1" class="neutral">Joining us for the next session.</span> <span id="sentence-2" class="neutral">My name is Nick Timiraos, I cover the economy for the Wall Street Journal.</span> <span id="sentence-3" class="neutral">And I want to thank Sabu for having me to moderate this panel with Austin Goolsbee, who is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.</span> <span id="sentence-4" class="neutral">Austin previously served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Barack Obama, and was a professor at the University of Chicago.</span> <span id="sentence-5" class="neutral">So, Austin, let's get right into what we're seeing in the economy right now.</span> <span id="sentence-6" class="bold">But last week, there was an inflation report that showed that the CPI showed that now for three months, inflation has been a little bit firmer than maybe what people were expecting it after we had seen better readings at the end of last year.</span> <span id="sentence-7" class="neutral">My first question to you Austin is have the the first three readings this year on inflation changed your view about how long it's going to take to get inflation all the way back to the Feds 2% goal.</span></p>

<p><b>Austan Goolsbee:</b> <span id="sentence-8" class="hawkish bold">Mechanically, yes. Just the way we add up the inflation.

<p><b>Nick Timiraos:</b> <span id="sentence-205" class="neutral">So you were talking a little bit earlier, has your estimate for the neutral rate of interest.</span> <span id="sentence-206" class="neutral">This is sort of the Nirvana where you're at your goal, you're probably you know, there's no shocks in the economy, very rare, but you know, you have to have some kind of estimate of what your neutral rate might be in that scenario.</span> <span id="sentence-207" class="neutral">Has your neutral rate estimate gone up?</span> <span id="sentence-208" class="neutral">Do you think there's a short run neutral rate that might be you know, higher right now but comes down to policy gets more restrictive is that they</span></p>

<p><b>Austan Goolsbee:</b> <span id="sentence-209" class="neutral">pulled a sleight of hand they're okay to call it the neutral rate is better.</span> <span id="sentence-210" class="neutral">Our star I budgeted hours and that's the same thing.</span> <span id="sentence-211" class="neutral">But when you say it as our star, then you realize like, wait a minute, somebody's got like a mathematical formula in there.</span> <span id="sentence-212" class="neutral">And to call it neutral is to make it sound better than my thing about our star and you can ask the research staff they don't like that.</span> <span id="sentence-213" class="neutral">I said, I started calling it our Sasquatch, because it's not fundamentally not observable.</span> <span id="sentence-214" class="neutral">Okay.</span> <span id="sentence-215" class="neutral">And so you can have their two styles of how do you identify what is our star?</span> <span id="sentence-216" class="neutral">One is you can build a model and John Williams as as done some of the most pathbreaking work on building those models and what goes into the model there are a bunch of slow moving things like demographics and and stuff like that.</span> <span id="sentence-217" class="neutral">Or you can indirectly say well, this was the policy and inflation was still rising.</span> <span id="sentence-218" class="neutral">So it must be that our star was higher.</span> <span id="sentence-219" class="neutral">I'm a little impatient with the r star is a long run concept and our whole debate in public seems to be about a short run long run rate.</span> <span id="sentence-220" class="neutral">And that's, I'm uncomfortable with that even concept, which really leads me back to the I'm mostly looking at the historical, recent historical, what's the real federal funds rate?</span> <span id="sentence-221" class="neutral">That's kind of my indicator.</span> <span id="sentence-222" class="neutral">Now, if you really want an R star, you can back out from the median SAP, they ask what do you think that rate will be in the long run?</span> <span id="sentence-223" class="neutral">And I think that median SCP is like two and a half percent.</span> <span id="sentence-224" class="neutral">And that might have moved a little bit but it hadn't moved a ton.</span> <span id="sentence-225" class="neutral">And you don't think of things like ours are moving a ton in the short run.</span> <span id="sentence-226" class="neutral">So I, I guess I'm a little impatient with the argument that you would see wild swings in long run interest rates over a short run period.</span></p>
<p><b>Nick Timiraos:</b> <span id="sentence-227" class="neutral">I want to turn it over to questions from the audience.</span> <span id="sentence-228" class="neutral">Are there any, any questions in the audience?</span> <span id="sentence-229" class="neutral">We have a mic if you could state your name and affiliation.</span></p>
<p><b>Austan Goolsbee:</b> <span id="sentence-230" class="neutral">James Madore.</span> <span id="sentence-231" class="neutral">I work for Newsday, and I want to ask you a little bit about the impact of migration, immigration, on our economy, because obviously we are seeing more people come to the country, the state that I live in lives and dies on immigration.</span> <span id="sentence-232" class="neutral">So how is immigration going to affect our economy in the short term and the long term?</span> <span id="sentence-233" class="neutral">Okay, super deep question.</span> <span id="sentence-234" class="neutral">Which I'm mostly not going to answer but I'm gonna say for us for fed where we are thing is dual mandate law tells us fed your job is stabilize prices, maximize employment.</span> <span id="sentence-235" class="dovish">How does immigration affect stabilizing prices and maximizing of employment A, it means aggregate job growth is higher than otherwise because population is growing in a way the measures of overheating in the economy are kind of per capita.</span> <span id="sentence-236" class="dovish">And so if the Capita is getting bigger, the aggregate total can be bigger on inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-237" class="neutral">I don't know what the impact on wages are at various parts of the distribution.</span> <span id="sentence-238" class="neutral">But I do know that there are some sectors in the economy that have had massive labor shortages through the COVID times where there are a high share of the workforce or immigrants and leisure and hospitality and in some of the other categories, you would think that you would see job growth stronger in those.</span> <span id="sentence-239" class="dovish">So I think in the short run, that there is more immigration makes the dual mandate goals a little easier to accomplish.</span> <span id="sentence-240" class="neutral">And then there's always the caveat of but isn't everything relative to what you expected it was going to be.</span> <span id="sentence-241" class="neutral">And there I don't so one thing we found out the CBO put out this report on immigration and it said last year, there were millions more people than we thought there were that it feels very impactful.</span> <span id="sentence-242" class="neutral">If everybody knows how many people are going to come in and then as many people exactly as many people as what we thought are what come in.</span> <span id="sentence-243" class="neutral">I think there are some aspects in which that's less impactful.</span>

<p><b>Lillian Berbick:</b><span id="sentence-1" class="neutral">Lillian Berbick Oregon Public Broadcasting.</span> <span id="sentence-2" class="neutral">I have a nerdy question and no fun question.</span> <span id="sentence-3" class="neutral">Are those different?</span></p>

<p><b>Austan Goolsbee:</b> <span id="sentence-4" class="neutral">They might be the same in this audience.</span> <span id="sentence-5" class="neutral">So my nerdy question is, you mentioned that you have kind of one tool in the toolbox.</span> <span id="sentence-6" class="neutral">But there's actually another tool that the Fed has that we haven't really seen be used, which is reserve requirements.</span> <span id="sentence-7" class="neutral">Do you feel like especially with some of the smaller bank failures that we saw last year of changing reserve requirements?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-8" class="neutral">This opens the door lens in the whole discussion about both the balance sheet and the what the capital requirements are.</span> <span id="sentence-9" class="neutral">I'm not going to get into the regulatory the banking system I view is overall, the safety and soundness of the banking system.</span> <span id="sentence-10" class="hawkish bold">Hinges critically on have them having adequate capital, I believe that they do have that but Vice Chair bar is is kind of the point person thinking through those.</span> <span id="sentence-11" class="neutral bold">The balance sheet is another tool in a way in the spirit of reserve requirements, but remember, brought broadly defined is still the same tool.</span> <span id="sentence-12" class="neutral bold">We're operating through a channel of through a credit channel that can be tightening or loosening.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-13" class="neutral">I'm a little uneasy if we draw we're trying to get sector specific in our like there's no monetary policy that's just for the housing industry just for manufacturing or or that kind of thing.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-14" class="neutral">I think mostly what we do on Capitol for banks should be about safety and soundness of the banking system.</span> <span id="sentence-15" class="neutral bold">Not really monetary policy and on the balance sheet.</span> <span id="sentence-16" class="neutral bold">We've been doing this Qt and running down the balance sheet, but everybody should understand that under the way we do monetary policy now since 2006, or seven or whenever we change to the so called ample reserves regime.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-17" class="neutral bold">You've got to have enough balance sheet that the private sector is not out, trying to hoard its own liquidity.</span> <span id="sentence-18" class="neutral bold">And that means the balance sheet is going to be bigger on a steady state basis than it ever was in the old days.</span> <span id="sentence-19" class="neutral bold">And if you get it too small.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-20" class="neutral">As I kind of say, my understanding is that the human body can live for three to four days with no water before you die.</span> <span id="sentence-21" class="neutral">And how long exactly depends on conditions?</span> <span id="sentence-22" class="neutral">Is it hot?</span> <span id="sentence-23" class="neutral">How human is it?</span> <span id="sentence-24" class="neutral">You know, did you drink a Gatorade right before you started?</span> <span id="sentence-25" class="neutral">But do you want to know like, what do we really want to figure out?</span> <span id="sentence-26" class="neutral">Oh no, it's 37 hours or it's played out like how many hours we're going to get to a point where the balance sheet.</span> <span id="sentence-27" class="neutral bold">It's definitely not a fixed number.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-28" class="neutral bold">It's probably not even a constant share of GDP, but it's going to be close to a constant share of GDP and GDP grows.</span> <span id="sentence-29" class="neutral bold">So balance sheet will stop shrinking will start growing eventually.</span> <span id="sentence-30" class="neutral">And it is kind of related to this question of bank reserves.</span> <span id="sentence-31" class="neutral bold">I don't think of that.</span> <span id="sentence-32" class="neutral bold">I think of that as something separate from our what we're doing with monetary policy.</span> <span id="sentence-33" class="neutral">Okay, time for the fun question.</span> <span id="sentence-34" class="neutral">Yeah, that well I thought that was a fun.</span> <span id="sentence-35" class="neutral">What's the I agree?</span></p>

<p>Lillian Berbick: <span id="sentence-36" class="neutral">Um, so, you know, reporting on monetary policy and fed movements can get really rote.</span> <span id="sentence-37" class="neutral">Like, here, we're gonna get to 2% is about a week and I say how was that wrote?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-38" class="neutral">Is there any stories about monetary policy and economic data that you wish were being told by journalists?</span></p>

<p><b>Austan Goolsbee:</b> <span id="sentence-39" class="neutral">let's answer a different question.</span> <span id="sentence-41" class="neutral">But related, the what?</span> <span id="sentence-42" class="neutral">What have we been missing?</span> <span id="sentence-43" class="dovish bold">If productivity growth is going to be as fast as it's been for the last three quarters?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-44" class="dovish bold">That's fundamentally going to change everything about the economy in a way and it would have direct implications for monetary policy.</span> <span id="sentence-45" class="dovish bold">It would put us back in an environment that would very much be like the late 90s, where you can have faster wage growth, without inflation gonna have faster GDP growth without generating inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-46" class="neutral">And that's a series that is noisy but it's worth absolutely paying attention to that.</span> <span id="sentence-47" class="neutral">That's not even mostly about the Fed.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-48" class="neutral bold">But it has definite implications for the Fed.</span> <span id="sentence-49" class="neutral">So I will watch that.</span> <span id="sentence-50" class="neutral">If you ask, are there stories about the Fed?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-51" class="neutral">Yes.</span> <span id="sentence-52" class="neutral">And I've dried so one of the stories was in Detroit, Chicago Fed has a Detroit branch.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-53" class="neutral">And our Detroit employees are super loyal to the Detroit Lions.</span> <span id="sentence-54" class="neutral">And the Detroit Lions after decades of being horrible, almost made the Superbowl and we run hundreds of millions of dollars of cash in and out of the Feds each day because we're we're bank to the banks.</span> <span id="sentence-55" class="neutral">So when they put cash in their ATMs, it's coming from us.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-56" class="neutral">So we have these bomb dogs, and our bomb dogs moonlight as the bomb sniffing dogs at the lions game.</span> <span id="sentence-57" class="neutral">So I told the people I was like, these are the hardest working dogs in Detroit.</span> <span id="sentence-58" class="neutral">You got to get them because some press coverage and they did.</span> <span id="sentence-59" class="neutral">They got up they went they went on TV and there were the dogs and N eyes.</span> <span id="sentence-60" class="neutral">I had said nothing to their greatest sniffing they're in the data dog kennel like I asked for permission.</span> <span id="sentence-61" class="neutral">Can I join you?</span> <span id="sentence-62" class="neutral">You know it was effing out the bonds.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-63" class="neutral">I said that if the lions one I was gonna give each of these dogs there's two of them over there Fox and.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-64" class="neutral">And krill Fox and krill I said Fox and krill get a steak.</span> <span id="sentence-65" class="neutral">We're gonna get a steak and give it to each one.</span> <span id="sentence-66" class="neutral">The Lions laws but then they had a vote of the Fed employees and by a 95 to five vote.</span> <span id="sentence-67" class="neutral">They said it wasn't the dog's fault that they went forward on fourth down.</span> <span id="sentence-68" class="neutral">So we gave him the stakes anyway.</span> <span id="sentence-69" class="neutral">And so there is a human side to the feds, especially the regional Feds that that is worth that is worth covering their role in the in the community right down here.</span> 
  </p>
<p><b>Sarah Foster: </b><span id="sentence-70" class="neutral">It would probably be wrong to call this a fun question, but thank you for being here, letting us ask you this.</span> <span id="sentence-71" class="neutral">I'm Sarah Foster at Bankrate.</span> <span id="sentence-72" class="neutral">I'm curious what you think about delinquency rates right now, particularly for credit cards and auto loans.</span> <span id="sentence-73" class="neutral">They've been rising even though the unemployment rate is low.</span> <span id="sentence-74" class="neutral">What would happen if there is a slight increase in the unemployment rate and kind of two part question?</span> <span id="sentence-75" class="neutral">Yeah, you know, considering how much more debt consumers have how some auto loans off cars are obviously not worth what they were a few years ago.</span> <span id="sentence-76" class="neutral">Could a slight increase results and maybe something slightly more painful thing worse?</span></p>
  
  <p>Austan Goolsbee: </p>
<span id="sentence-77" class="neutral">Okay.</span> <span id="sentence-78" class="neutral">This is this an important question.</span> <span id="sentence-79" class="neutral">I'm glad you raised it when I talked about the crosscurrents.</span> <span id="sentence-80" class="neutral">And I said, Look, there's some things about the job market that don't really look like overheating.</span> <span id="sentence-81" class="neutral">They look like coming back to normal.</span> <span id="sentence-82" class="hawkish">There are also some measures in the economy that historically do not portend well.</span> <span id="sentence-83" class="hawkish">So, if you look at normal times, if the delinquencies rate of consumer loans starts rising, that is often a leading indicator for things are about to get worse.</span>

<p><span id="sentence-84" class="neutral">The only thing so that that is an area of concern.</span> <span id="sentence-85" class="neutral">What people are trying to figure out right now is that's went way down.</span> <span id="sentence-86" class="neutral">Okay, so it is rising, but the level that it's risen to is if I just told you the level and you compare that to pre COVID It doesn't look that different, but if I told you delinquencies went up by however many percent you would say, Oh, if they go up that much, that's a terrible sign.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-87" class="neutral">So that's a different way to say we don't know sniffing Musk commands.</span> <span id="sentence-88" class="neutral">You know where that's one we're watching the consumer balance sheet got unprecedentedly strong after stimulus that the excess savings you're you're familiar with that that old fight so I think much of that is gone.</span> <span id="sentence-89" class="dovish">We're back to more normal levels.</span> <span id="sentence-90" class="dovish bold">Overall consumer debt levels are not especially high.</span> <span id="sentence-91" class="hawkish bold">But look, as you know, when things start to turn wrong on the real side of the economy, that doesn't just tend to be like, Oh, that happened one month and then they don't continue.</span> <span id="sentence-92" class="hawkish bold">So that's that's our concern.</span> <span id="sentence-93" class="hawkish bold">I think this consumer delinquencies is one of the that's one of the more concerning parts in the in the data at this moment.</span> </p>

<p><b>Chuck Jaffe: </b><span id="sentence-96" class="neutral">Chuck Jaffe, with money life and the Fed historically, and what experts say all the time is that the Fed doesn't necessarily make moves until things break.</span> <span id="sentence-97" class="neutral">But a lot of the time Well, a lot of people who were watching and expecting rate cuts this year, were saying that if the Fed made them early this year, that the Fed was moving from a position of strength, but now that rate cuts and I know you're not going to speculate on what's going to cause them or when they're going to happen.</span> <span id="sentence-98" class="neutral">But now that we are looking at rate cuts taking longer when the Fed finally moves on rate cuts, will it be moving from a position of strength or will it be moving from a position of weakness?</span></p>

<p><b>Austan Goolsbee:</b> <span id="sentence-99" class="neutral">The only reason I hesitate is that last part of is that a position of strength or position of weakness on the ground I can't I can't fully understand what what that means.</span> <span id="sentence-100" class="neutral">Like what like what does it mean to be a position of weakness or position you are forced to act because otherwise you will get to that or things break.</span> <span id="sentence-101" class="neutral">If you don't do that you're gonna fall behind they're gonna fall behind.</span> <span id="sentence-102" class="hawkish">Okay, if we don't want to always be late.</span> <span id="sentence-103" class="hawkish">We want to anticipate and that's the language in the statement of are we on a path to 2% inflation connotes that to my mind that we are forward looking we're not you don't just want to have what happened last month to the CPI that should determine what the rate should be.</span> <span id="sentence-104" class="neutral">Now, that said when the SEP comes out, so like, take in December, the Feds median, SEP said there would be three rate cuts and 24 and the market immediately concluded that must mean seven.</span> <span id="sentence-105" class="neutral">And they and so then the market said they're going to be seven cuts.</span> <span id="sentence-106" class="neutral">And then Nick is how to be so why do you say three if the market says seven?</span> <span id="sentence-107" class="neutral">Look, the thing is, there's only eight meetings a year.</span> <span id="sentence-108" class="neutral">So my thing is you faff around you're gonna find out you know, and so the Silicon Valley just click up don't don't fight the Fed.</span> <span id="sentence-109" class="neutral">We had a board member was said he tells us people, we can fight the Fed as long as we want but the last time I checked, they're still undefeated.</span> <span id="sentence-110" class="neutral">And there is a component of Silicon Valley Bank had hedges on the interest rate and they got rid of the hedges.</span> <span id="sentence-111" class="neutral">If you go back and read the bar report.</span> <span id="sentence-112" class="neutral">Why did they get rid of the hedges?</span> <span id="sentence-113" class="neutral">Because they took a bet.</span> <span id="sentence-114" class="neutral">The Fed will never raise rates as much as they as they say, and the market is telling us that the rates are going to come down.</span><span id="sentence-116" class="neutral">I'm not.</span> <span id="sentence-117" class="neutral">I came from the old school.</span> <span id="sentence-118" class="neutral">My friend and mentor was Paul Volcker.</span> <span id="sentence-119" class="neutral">And Paul Volcker used to always say our job is to act and their job is to react and let's not get the order mixed up.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-120" class="hawkish">So I think that means I'm saying whether we wait or don't wait, we're always operating from a position of strength.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-121" class="hawkish">And we should be forward looking definitely not just backward looking.</span></p>

<p><b>Nick Timiraos:</b> <span id="sentence-122" class="neutral">Before before we finish, I want to be stuck.</span> <span id="sentence-123" class="neutral">But in we only have time for one but actually yet another one.</span> <span id="sentence-124" class="neutral">So we didn't talk about the election.</span> <span id="sentence-125" class="neutral">I thought it might come up in the q&amp;a.</span> <span id="sentence-126" class="neutral">You know, before you took this job.</span> <span id="sentence-127" class="neutral">You spent time in the political arena, you would go on Fox News as you know, defend the Democratic Party priorities.</span> <span id="sentence-128" class="neutral">You were very critical of Donald Trump, especially after he lost the election.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-129" class="neutral">And I know the Fed says it doesn't take politics into account but given how you felt about Trump.</span> <span id="sentence-130" class="neutral">Can you unseal that when you're balancing the trade offs?</span> <span id="sentence-131" class="neutral">Look, I told you I'm a Fed man.</span> <span id="sentence-132" class="neutral">Now and the Fed does not include elections in our we have a mandate there's nothing about even if you elections in the mandate, there's nothing about the stock market.</span></p>

<p><b>Austan Goolsbee:</b> <span id="sentence-133" class="neutral">Are you tell me the weather I tell you what code I'm wearing with this what we're doing I have no, you you read this minutes.</span> <span id="sentence-134" class="neutral">You read the transcripts?</span> <span id="sentence-135" class="neutral">The FOMC The elections are not in the transcripts, and they shouldn't be the mandate is what the dual mandate is what drives our decisions.</span> <span id="sentence-136" class="neutral">And that's what's going to drive our decisions this year.</span> <span id="sentence-137" class="neutral">Austin, thank you for joining us.</span> <span id="sentence-138" class="neutral">Stay tuned.</span>
