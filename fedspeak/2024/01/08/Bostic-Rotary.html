Fed’s Bostic: The current pace of balance sheet normalization is appropriate. The Fed remains in a situation of ample reserves. Fed’s Bostic: I will be looking for early signs that changes in unemployment are starting to accelerate. I am not seeing it yet. Fed’s Bostic: I sees an initial rate cut in the third quarter. Fed’s Bostic: There is still space for wages to grow without inflation. Fed’s Bostic: The labor markets remain strong in the aggregate and suggest continued momentum in the economy. Fed’s Bostic: Business contacts continue to say they are in hiring mode. Fed’s Bostic: Labor market risks are much more balanced, but many sectors are not showing growth. Fed’s Bostic: Inflation and employment mandates are not yet in conflict. Fed’s Bostic: sees 50 basis points in rate cuts in 2024 Fed’s Bostic: I am comfortable with the current rate level. Fed’s Bostic: The outlook now is not for inflation to rebound. But the Fed still needs to pay attention. Fed’s Bostic: Policy will still need to be restrictive at the end of the year. But progress on inflation will warrant lower rates. Fed’s Bostic: Concentrated job growth means slowing is occurring, the question is if job growth overall hits a cliff. Fed’s Bostic: The topline job numbers have been pretty strong, but the recent strength has been focused in a relatively small part of the economy. Fed’s Bostic: At this moment, I am not comfortable declaring victory. The Fed needs to remain diligent and short run attentive. Fed’s Bostic: We’re on path to 2% inflation today, the goal is to stay on the path. Fed’s Bostic: At this point, shorter-term measures of inflation, such as over three-six-months, are more important.

Fed’s Bostic: Rise in unemployment has been ‘far less’ than would be typical Fed’s Bostic: The Fed can let restrictive policy continue to work to slow inflation, I expect the process will remain orderly.

<p>Bostic on Monday repeated his expectation for two rate cuts this year, and told reporters after the event that he expects the first cut in the third quarter; Bostic also told reporters it’s an “open question” if and when the Fed should alter the pace at which it reduces its portfolio of assets, adding that the current pace is appropriate.</p>
