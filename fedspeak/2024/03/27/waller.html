<p><span class="neutral bold">Thank you, Barbara, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 My subject, as it often is, is the outlook for the U.S. economy, and how that affects the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) continuing effort to reduce inflation to a sustained level of 2 percent while maintaining a healthy labor market.</span></p>
<p><span class="dovish bold">We made a lot of headway toward our inflation goal in 2023, and the labor market moved substantially into better balance, all while holding the unemployment rate below 4 percent for nearly two years.</span> <span class="neutral bold">But the data we have received so far this year has made me uncertain about the speed of continued progress.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">Back in February, I noted that data on fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP) as well as January data on job growth and inflation came in hotter than expected.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">I concluded then that we needed time to verify that the progress on inflation we saw in the second half of 2023 would continue, which meant there was no rush to begin cutting interest rates to normalize the stance of monetary policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="hawkish bold">Over the past month, additional economic data has reinforced this view.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">February job gains moved back up to 275,000, making the three-month average a strong 265,000, and various inflation measures have continued to come in hot.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation jumped to 0.4 percent on a monthly basis in January, after averaging around 0.1 percent in October through December last year.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">And with February consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index inflation data in hand, some forecasts are predicting core PCE inflation may be revised up for January and is expected to come in at 0.3 percent for February, which we will learn about on Friday.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">Adding this new data to what we saw earlier in the year reinforces my view that there is no rush to cut the policy rate.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">Indeed, it tells me that it is prudent to hold this rate at its current restrictive stance perhaps for longer than previously thought to help keep inflation on a sustainable trajectory toward 2 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="dovish bold">I continue to believe that further progress will make it appropriate for the FOMC to begin reducing the target range for the federal funds rate this year.</span> <span class="neutral bold">But until that progress materializes, I am not ready to take that step.</span> <span class="dovish">Fortunately, the strength of the U.S. economy and resilience of the labor market mean the risk of waiting a little longer to ease policy is small and significantly lower than acting too soon and possibly squandering our progress on inflation.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">Turning to the performance of the U.S. economy, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model, based on all current data, predicts first quarter growth in real GDP of 2.1 percent at an annual rate.</span> <span class="neutral">Similarly, the consensus from the Blue Chip survey of private sector forecasters is 2 percent.</span> <span class="neutral">This would be a significant slowdown from the average of around 4 percent in the second half of 2024 but still quite solid growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">Consumer spending, the largest component of GDP, seems to be moderating this quarter.</span> <span class="neutral">Retail sales fell significantly in January and then retraced about half of that decline in February.</span> <span class="neutral">Smoothing out these swings, they clearly indicate a moderation in goods spending from the second half of last year.</span> <span class="neutral">However, services spending, excluding energy, grew moderately in January, which offset to some extent the decline in goods spending.</span> <span class="neutral">I will be watching on Friday morning to see what the February data on personal income and spending show.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">On the business side, surveys of purchasing managers in February continued to report results we have been hearing for over a year.</span> <span class="neutral">For manufacturers, the Institute for Supply Management indicated a slight contraction in activity, with new orders and production moving down a bit.</span> <span class="neutral">This contrasts with nonmanufacturing businesses that continued to see an expansion in activity, with measures of new orders and business activity on the higher end of their readings over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral bold">Now let me turn to the labor market.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">The data is sending a mixed message on how supply and demand are evolving.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">As I noted earlier, payroll data estimate that employers added 275,000 jobs in February.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">This robust gain is not only above the 265,000 average level of job creation since November, but also above the 251,000 monthly average for all of 2023.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">Recent gains have been broad based across most sectors, rather than concentrated in a few sectors, which may be a sign that demand is not moderating as much as is needed to support continued progress on inflation.</span> <span class="neutral">Conversely, the household survey estimated that the unemployment rate rose to 3.9 percent in February.</span> <span class="dovish">But that increase was driven mostly by an outsized rise in the number of 16- to 24-year-olds counted as unemployed.</span> <span class="dovish">Youth employment tends to be volatile, so this rate may drop back in the next few months and, if so, pull the overall unemployment rate back down as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="dovish">Another sign of loosening in the labor market is that the number of people quitting their jobs has fallen below the levels just before the pandemic.</span> <span class="neutral">I believe most workers quit their jobs for better pay or other benefits.</span> <span class="neutral">So less turnover means firms do not need to enhance their compensation packages to attract workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">In reviewing wage pressures, the most recent data suggest nominal wage growth has continued to ease.</span> <span class="neutral">But most of these measures are still above their pre-pandemic levels.</span> <span class="neutral">And, considering overall compensation—wages and benefits —here, too, growth has slowed but remains a bit elevated.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">Looking across various indicators of labor demand, there hasn't been much change in recent months.</span> <span class="neutral">Job openings drifted down last year but then flattened out recently at a still elevated level, while the pace of hiring is close to its pre-pandemic level.</span> <span class="neutral">With strong labor supply and little apparent change in demand in recent months, the ratio of vacancies to people looking for work has been roughly flat after declining significantly in 2023.</span> <span class="neutral">At 1.4 jobs for each person looking, that ratio is down from 2022's peak of around 2 and indicates that the labor market has loosened up.</span> <span class="neutral">But the vacancies-to-unemployed rate is still higher than the 1.2 that prevailed before the pandemic and has held steady around 1.4 for several months, which suggests that the labor market remains tight.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral bold">Let me turn to a topic related to the labor market that has important implications for the longer-term course of U.S. economy: productivity.</span> <span class="dovish">When productivity across the economy grows quickly, it means that output and income can also grow quickly without putting upward pressure on inflation, so it supports rising living standards.</span> <span class="dovish">And lately, productivity has been growing fast.</span> <span class="dovish">Over the final three quarters of 2023, it grew at a pace a bit under 4 percent, much faster than the average since the 1970s.</span> <span class="neutral">Some have argued that this must be why we had such strong economic growth in 2023, even while inflation was slowing.</span> <span class="neutral">Perhaps, they say, we are at the start of another era of fast and sustained productivity growth, such as the United States experienced from 1998 through 2004.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">Believe me, I hope this is true, because it would be the basis for broadly shared prosperity that raises living standards, but I am skeptical that it will last.</span> <span class="neutral">The first thing to note is that productivity growth is notoriously volatile.</span> <span class="neutral">Though productivity grew fast for the final nine months of last year, it actually fell in the first quarter of 2023 and rather substantially for all of 2022.</span> <span class="neutral">One may view this fast growth as making up for the earlier declines.</span> <span class="neutral">In fact, smoothing across the past two years, productivity growth averages a bit above 1.25 percent annually.</span> <span class="neutral">Also keep in mind that periods of fast growth that last more than a few years are unusual, and it is also difficult to be sure about the causes.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">When thinking about productivity, one has to distinguish between factors that raise productivity in the short run but ultimately are one-off increases in the level of productivity, as opposed to those that increase the long-run growth rate of productivity so that the level is constantly increasing.</span> <span class="neutral">So let me posit several factors that have been suggested for explaining the recent increase in productivity and try to place them in the one-off or long-run buckets.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">Many people point to recent large investment projects in the United States, such as those associated with the Inflation Reduction Act or artificial intelligence, as boosting productivity.</span> <span class="neutral">But these investments will take place over many years and may not have done much yet to add to the nation's productive capacity.</span> <span class="neutral">While it is possible they could increase longer-run productivity growth, it remains to be seen if they will.</span> <span class="neutral">Thus, they are unlikely to explain the recent rise in productivity growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">The recent surge in business start-ups after a sustained lull has also been mentioned as a factor.</span> <span class="neutral">Like the investment projects, it may be causing a boost to productivity, but it is likely to occur over a number of years.</span> <span class="neutral">And, unless the current boom in new business formation continues into the future, once again this factor will at best raise the level of productivity over the short term and not the long-run growth rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">Another factor that is often pointed to is the resolution of supply chain problems.</span> <span class="neutral">But once the supply chain issues are resolved, this boost to productivity growth will end, so this clearly is a short-run factor that will simply raise the level but not the long-run growth rate of productivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">Another potential cause of recent productivity growth is that the pandemic changed how we work and use technology.</span> <span class="neutral">While I certainly can see how this could affect the level of productivity and short-run growth, once we have made those changes, they're done, so I don't see this as a driver of sustained productivity growth.</span> <span class="neutral">I have also heard the argument that when labor turnover was very high during the pandemic, new hires were being trained, and by the time they were ready to start contributing to production, they would leave for a new job and start a new training process.</span> <span class="neutral">Now that the pace of turnover is back down to normal levels, firms are reaping the benefits of keeping newly trained workers who then move up the learning curve at the firm.</span> <span class="neutral">Again, while I see this raising the level of productivity in the short run, it may simply be returning productivity to previous levels.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">I will be watching how productivity evolves in the near term.</span> <span class="neutral">I will keep my fingers crossed for more good news, but I am not convinced that the recent boom in productivity growth will continue.</span> <span class="neutral">Therefore, I will keep that in mind as I form my judgments about the economic outlook and appropriate setting of monetary policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="hawkish bold">Now let's talk about inflation.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">We made a lot of headway in reducing inflation in the past year or so, although the readings in the past two months have been disappointing.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">Both total CPI inflation and core inflation that excludes energy and food rounded to a 0.4 percent increase for the month of February, which is obviously not progress toward our inflation goal.</span> <span class="hawkish">While housing services prices, which rose in January, moderated a bit, core goods prices, which had been falling recently, rose due to elevated import price increases.</span> <span class="hawkish">In trying to judge what the underlying trend is for inflation, I tend to look at annualized core measures over 3 or 6 months.</span> <span class="hawkish">For most of a year, I watched these numbers come down more quickly than 12-month readings, telling me that we were making substantial progress.</span> <span class="hawkish">But, more recently, the 3-month core CPI, which was running at a 3.3 percent rate in December, rose to 4.2 percent in February.</span> <span class="hawkish">Six-month core CPI, which was also 3.3 percent in December, was up to 3.9 percent last month.</span> <span class="hawkish">These shorter-term inflation measures are now telling me that progress has slowed and may have stalled.</span> <span class="hawkish">But we will need more data to know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="hawkish bold">The FOMC uses personal consumption expenditure inflation data to measure progress toward our 2 percent goal, and we won't get those results for February until Friday.</span> <span class="hawkish">But, as I noted at the start, based on the consumer and producer prices that we do have, estimates suggest that core PCE inflation is likely to be elevated.</span> <span class="hawkish">Though the February reading is estimated to step down from January's, this recent pace would not represent significant progress toward 2 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">Let me pause here and make an important point about how I think about and want to talk about adverse developments such as this recent inflation data and how as a policymaker I manage risks to the economic outlook.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">It is appropriate to point out that a month or two of data does not necessarily indicate a trend, and there are good reasons to think that progress on inflation will be uneven but likely to continue down toward 2 percent.</span> <span class="hawkish">At the same time, monetary policy is data driven, and I do want to take it into account when formulating my economic outlook.</span> <span class="hawkish">While I don't want to over-react to two months of data, I do think it is appropriate to react to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="neutral">There is ample evidence that the recent data has also been taken on board by both financial markets and forecasters in adjusting their views of the economic outlook.</span> <span class="hawkish">The markets have pulled back the number of expected rate cuts in 2024.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">FOMC participants have also adjusted their views on policy in response to recent data and it is reflected in the Summary of Economic Projections.</span> <span class="hawkish">Comparing the December 2023 projections to those just released, one sees that the median number of cuts in the federal funds rate for 2024 is still three, but the dots for 2024 have moved up, meaning at least several policymakers removed one or more cuts from their projection.</span> <span class="hawkish">In fact, the number of policymakers expecting more than three cuts in 2024 decreased significantly, while the number expecting two or fewer increased.</span> <span class="hawkish">I interpret this as showing that the Committee is not over-reacting to the recent data but is not discounting it either.</span></p>
<p><span class="hawkish">In my view, it is appropriate to reduce the overall number of rate cuts or push them further into the future in response to the recent data.</span> <span class="neutral">This reflects the reality of managing an outlook in real time as data comes in.</span> <span class="hawkish">Subsequent data may well alter this outlook again, but we shall see.</span> <span class="hawkish">Based on what we know now, there is no urgency in taking that step.</span></p>
<p><span class="hawkish bold">So where do I see things standing?</span> <span class="hawkish">I see economic output and the labor market showing continued strength, while progress in reducing inflation has slowed.</span> <span class="hawkish">Because of these signs, I see no rush in taking the step of beginning to ease monetary policy.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">The target range for the federal funds rate has been 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent since last July, and I believe that this restrictive level is helping to reduce imbalances in the economy and continuing to put downward pressure on inflation.</span> <span class="hawkish">All indications are that the economy continues to grow at a healthy pace.</span> <span class="neutral">While retail sales and some other indicators suggest a softening in demand this quarter from the second half of last year, when growth accelerated, the evidence for a significant slowdown is sparse.</span> <span class="hawkish">Meanwhile, as the labor market continues to add jobs at a rapid pace, some signs point to improvement in the imbalance between supply and demand, but others indicate continued tightness.</span></p>
<p><span class="hawkish bold">My judgment on the balance of risks for monetary policy, which I explained in a speech on February 22, hasn't changed:</span> <span class="hawkish">The risk of waiting a little longer to cut rates is significantly lower than acting too soon.</span> <span class="hawkish">Cutting the policy rate too soon and risking a sustained rebound in inflation is something I want to avoid.</span></p>
<p><span class="hawkish">As a result, in the absence of an unexpected and material deterioration in the economy, I am going to need to see at least a couple months of better inflation data before I have enough confidence that beginning to cut rates will keep the economy on a path to 2 percent inflation.</span> <span class="neutral">Fortunately, we can wait to see how the data come in before deciding the appropriate time to start lowering the policy rate.</span> <span class="hawkish">The remarkable U.S. economy keeps on chugging along, adding jobs at a rate that over time will keep unemployment near its current, historically low rate.</span> <span class="neutral">But the overall strength of the U.S. economy makes it a fairly easy decision to wait a little longer to get a better understanding of the trajectory of inflation and, when appropriate, begin easing policy.</span></p>
