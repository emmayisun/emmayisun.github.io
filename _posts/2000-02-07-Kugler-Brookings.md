Don Kohn: Well, thank you very much, Governor Kugler. I think you lived up to Ceci's billing. You had a lot of information there on inflation, labor markets. You made your views very clear. So we're honored that you chose, Brookings for your first speech. And and it was it was a good one.

Adriana Kugler: Thank you. Don.

Don Kohn: So I think let's see if we can dig in a little bit here. You've emphasized that the committee's job is not done, that your eyes are on inflation, and the primary emphasis right now, anyhow, is hitting that price stability part of the dual, the dual mandate. So what would you be looking for? I mean, we've heard Jay Powell and others say they're looking for some more good data. I'm not sure exactly what that is. Could you spell out a little bit more what you would like to see before you decided that it was time to begin easing those interest rates, so that you could be confident that you were getting to the 2%.

Adriana Kugler: So, that's a great question, Don. I don't want to speak for the chair, but I will speak for myself.

Don Kohn Right. And I remember having to say that all the time. With Ben, in the audience, I had to say it.

Adriana Kugler But, what would we have seen obviously, as I said, is, rapid disinflation in particular in the second half of last year. And if you look at some of these six month and even three month measures, we're already hitting the 2% or even below the 2%, right? So people are wondering, well, what else? Right? So the issue for me is if you look at these three categories of inflation that I mentioned, goods, housing, and services except housing, they're very telling. Goods inflation started falling all they way back at the beginning of 22. Housing inflation, as I said, because of the way that it is measured mostly is pretty persistent, but we expect it to continue coming down given market rents, information that we have and better data on your rents. So that will continue coming down. But that only started in 2023, maybe around mid 23. Housing services. Services x housing, on the other hand, only started coming down in the second half of 23. It had been very, very persistent, very stubborn. And that, as I mentioned, accounts for 50% of the PC index. So that's the element, one of the elements, I should say, because there are many other elements to that I'll be watching for. But that's one of the elements that I'll be watching to see continued and sustained declines in. Right. I will be watching for the services x housing to continue showing us this inflation, because that is a key component. Indeed. Of course, there are other components such as wage growth, moderation. That's key because as I explained in my speech, right? That feeds into services housing inflation. So there are a number of elements, but that is certainly one of the elements that for me is important. And it's not that we haven't made good progress. We have indeed, we made very rapid progress. It's about saying that it's sustainable and that is durable. And that is very important to all of us.

Don Kohn To clarify that inflation doesn't, the services x housing inflation by itself doesn't need to get down to two in order to, but it does need to be low enough that a lower level of goods inflation would then you would average to two is I.

Adriana Kugler Absolutely I mean goods inflation. We have seen deflation in terms of goods prices. Right? I mean, we have seen a decline in prices in many goods categories across the board. So that is happening already. So that may level off some. So it may work in the opposite direction. That's about a quarter of the total PC index. And we see some of these pressures from the broadening of the conflict in the Middle East that could contribute
for some of that goods inflation to also come down, the lower levels of water in the
Panama Canal because of the El Nino. Right? I mean, we we have it coming all ways,
right? We think about all sorts of issues that could push up maybe a little bit goods
inflation, which means we need to compensate. Also, as you said, with this other aspect,
which before had been very stubborn, but it's certainly moving in the right direction. And
we want to see that continue. I want to see that continue for sure.

Don Kohn So let's, turn to the labor market. You mentioned wages and declining, wage
growth. So do you think some people have said that if productivity is one and a half ish,
then wages have to be, wage growth has to be three and a half ish. So are you waiting
until wage growth gets down there. Is that one of the key factors or, how are you judging,
you said labor markets are nearly in balance, but not quite in balance. What would you be
looking at to see those, whether those labor markets are in balance and how what how
does how do wage growth factor into that discussion?

Adriana Kugler Thank you. Thank you for that question. I definitely think demand and
supply for labor coming more into balance. We have seen some moderation of of demand
for labor. We have seen job postings come down by about 25% since their height, and
we're seeing a little bit less hiring. As I said, the good news is that we haven't seen that
lower demand for labor show up as layoffs at least. I mean, I know there's some people in
the media here, technology sector, there's some spotty layoffs in a few parts of the
economy, but it's not showing up in the aggregate data. Right? So it's not coming up in big
numbers. So that's one side we're continuing to see that there's some moderation in labor
demand. Labor supply has really helped, I would say in the last year. As you know, during
the pandemic, people withdrew out of the labor force in big numbers. And that has really
changed with some excess retirements during that time. So many of those people will not
be coming back. The good news is prime age workers, some labor participation of prime
age workers is had pre-pandemic levels or above. Even in the case of prime age women,
we hit record levels on labor force participation from prime age women back last June, and
those numbers are still close to record levels, to be honest. So that's really helping.

The immigration stories also helping. Immigrants entering the labor force really helps,
especially in some sectors. As I mentioned in construction, they make up a quarter of the
labor force. In leisure and hospitality they make up 20% of the labor force, so they really
make a difference in certain sectors. And according to census, so back in December,
census just released new numbers and population growth and labor force growth, they tell
us that about 1 million people enter between June of 22 and June of 2023.

The CBO has released numbers, which tells us that those numbers are even bigger. All
right. So those numbers are probably helping in terms of labor force participation. And
maybe some of those immigrants haven't even fully come in to participate in the labor
force. So maybe we're still to see some some impetus in labor force participation, from that
side. So that's helping. And again, that brings us more into balance. Another aspect which
I would say is usually unappreciated. But, you know, as a labor economist, I pay attention
to these things is, improvements in match quality, match quality and the speed of matches.
That's essentially, an increase in effective labor force participation. There is evidence of
that. So that that's another additional impetus on labor force, on the labor force side, that
really helps to bring this into balance. Now, as to your question, we do need wage
moderation. We have been seeing it, especially in the services sector, as I mentioned,
from 5.2 to 4.4. All of the data, whether you use ECI, whether used an average hourly

earnings, no matter what data you use, show you that trend down, has been happening.
And in some sectors, as I mentioned leisure and hospitality, they came down from 14% to
4.4%. So that that's happening, it's very real and it's making its way through. Right? In
terms of filtering through prices to lower prices. Now, where do we need it to be exactly?
That's not so clear, right. I wouldn't pin it to a number. I do want to see that continued
trend. But it depends on productivity. It depends on markups. It depends on many other
factors. So I would say roughly we think it needs to still come down some more. And we're
not quite there yet, but it's definitely moving in the right direction.

Don Kohn So I was about to ask you about productivity. You just brought it up. We've had
two big quarters of productivity growth. Do you think productivity is in the process of
picking up or is that just make up for earlier misses? I think from 2019 or so we're still
about one seven or so, something like that. So how are you looking for that productivity.

Adriana Kugler So the way we usually measure productivity says as productivity per
worker. Right? So naturally as there's some moderation in labor demand that's going to
pick up that that's one factor that is contributing to that. And if that continues that will
continue to happen. But the other parties is technical change, which everybody's talking
about. Right? AI and an actual technical change and, and productivity changes that are
here to stay. And I think it's too early to tell. Right. And we need to see if generative AI is in
fact going to, to be here, to stay, to make a difference. Across the board in many
industries.

Don Kohn Okay. Yeah, I agree, for what it's worth. Some of the factors you cited. So the
increase in labor force participation, maybe even the degree of immigration, the unwinding
of the Covid, Covid supply chain issues, so the remarkable performance of the U.S.
economy is, importantly, as you've emphasized, a result of increases in supply as well as
the Feds damping of demand, is there a risk that that those increases in supply won't
continue would make, would make your job somewhat harder, to, continue that progress
toward inflation? So that's one of the things you'll be watching.

Adriana Kugler Absolutely. I, I think your characterization is, is right that the, the situation
we're in now is related to both what has happened from our side at the Fed on, on the
demand side and the increase, restrictive stance of policy as well as the supply side.
Right? I mean, we see supply side, issues as winding down, as I mentioned in my speech,
they have been healing, but I do not think they're fully healed. I think there's still room.
There's still room to go on the supply side, both in goods and in terms of labor. I.
Mentioned extensively where I think we can still potentially make some increased progress
in terms of the labor supply side, in terms of the good side. I would say there are many
measures on supply disruptions and how much, they have gone away or not. They
instituted for, for supply management, for example, has some measures. They showed,
delays in deliveries, backlogs, all of those seem to have gone away. But on the other
hand, if you ask people in manufacturing about whether they have full access to work at
capacity, they tell you they're still seeing shortages in materials. There is about 20% of
companies that are still seeing shortages in materials, in production, in manufacturing.
That did come down from 45% by 21. But but there's still some substantial, right,
disruptions that are, that are still there that kind of still continue to, to work their way
through and help us.

Don Kohn So some of the goods disinflation could be, pardon my language, transitory. I
said that you didn't say that. But some of it may not persist. Right? I mean that's a that
that's something to keep looking at.

Adriana Kugler As I said, there has been a whole lot of good disinflation since, since early

Don Kohn Right.

Adriana Kugler And and right now we're seeing deflation. Yeah, we're seeing a reduction
in in prices of many goods. Okay.

Don Kohn So let me ask a little bit about where, we've discussed a little bit about what
you'll be looking at for when to begin easing off policy. Let's talk a little bit about where the
ultimate destination would be. So in the Federal Reserve's, quarterly forecast, the median
projection by FOMC participants is for interest rates to settle out. Nominal interest rates
are 2.5%. But there are a lot of people who think that there are upward pressures on those
longer term interest rates or increase deficits. They're building supply side resilience, or
things like that. So how are you thinking about once the path begins? Where is it going to,
is it going to portend a bit higher, or star a bit higher final settling place for or for interest
rates?

Adriana Kugler So, as you know, there is a lot of uncertainty in measuring the near-term
rate of interest. So deficits come in persistence of, of demand, persistence of these,
dissolution of supply side disruptions, but even technology and population. Right? So there
is a whole lot of uncertainty. So I don't think anyone is about to find out what are stories
today. Right. But but we do think about these issues, right. I think more important than
thinking where exactly we're going to end up is what that path will be. And thinking about
the different factors that will be relevant in determining where we need to go next. So as I
said before, I think this inflation is clearly happening and it's happening at a good pace. It's
continuing. We see reasons, as I mentioned, to see that it would continue. I think, growth
and employment have been resilient. So we see that side of our mandate also as us
moving so far in the right direction. Now the job is not done yet, so we will certainly move
forward in terms of the Federal funds rate. And that path will depend on how we get, and
how we start seeing our movement towards our target. So we're targeting inflation, so that
will be critical. Having said that, I do think and I am watching closely because historically
we have seen incidents where unemployment rises suddenly without much warning. So
we're watching that also closely. And that will also determine our path. But I would say the
path is what is most important than the ultimate end goal, which which we won't know until
we're done with it.

Don Kohn All right. Thank you. Let me ask one more question before we turn to the
audience. Financial stability issues. So very prominent, in the news today are concerns
about commercial real estate exposures at regional banks. Their equity, their share prices
are down sharply. Do you see the CRE problems, office buildings and some retail as a real
threat to financial stability? How do you judge how how well is the bank? Will the banking
system cope with this, oncoming repricing of, of commercial real estate?

Adriana Kugler Yeah. Let let me just generally say that that there, there's significant
sources of resilience in terms of financial stability. For example, the balance sheets of
households and businesses seem to be solid. The banking sector, despite the events last
March, as seems to be sound, generally sound, though we continue to monitor closely. I
do. I do pay a lot of attention to CRE as a source of vulnerability. I think it is, something we
need to continue to monitor. Valuations appear to be much higher than than the actual
fundamentals. And the supplies in particular for, office space. And I think, you know, we

have seen changes in return to office, policies in people working from home, all sorts of
things that that change the need for office space. So there seems to be some issues, with
valuation, which I haven't fully realized because there have been very few transactions in
the recent past in those properties. So we don't know exactly, but we're certainly watching
very closely that side as well as non-banking sector institutions as well.

Don Kohn So but overall, you would say the regional banks, the banking sector itself is
well capitalized and liquid. There may be. I mean, how are you, have you done a particular
analysis of some of these regional banks that have the exposures?

Adriana Kugler I actually do serving in a subcommittee for small and regional banks. And
so that that's something we pay attention to. Right? We pay attention to exposure to
commercial real estate. We pay attention to how well capitalized banks are. So we're
definitely keeping a close eye on those issues.

Don Kohn Okay. Thank you. So let's turn to the audience. Yes. And make let's make sure
these are questions.

Audience member Thank you. Yes. You've presented and discussed a lot of very
favorable macroeconomic data, but a person who cares about who the next president is
well aware of the fact that, at a micro level, people don't think the administration is doing a
very good job on the economy. So what has to happen for the macro developments to be
reflected in micro developments?

Adriana Kugler So, I'm not going to speak for the administration because as you know,
the Federal Reserve is an independent and nonpolitical agency. So I'm going to I kind of
speak for how I see, right, that that potential disparity between the macro data and how
people are feeling that data in their real lives. Right? So I, I mentioned I care about this,
right? I don't just care about. Right, the aggregate numbers and the average numbers. I
realize when we talk to a lot of people as members of the board, we talk to a lot of people
from across the country, from different communities to hear their stories as well. So I think
there's a notion right? The data only sees the average. And we do realize, there are
differences between different groups. For example, as I said, household balance sheets
are in pretty good shape, but we're seeing some weakening of household balance sheets
for those in the lower half of things. Tuition, increased pressures in terms of excess
savings disappearing right after some of the help that they received during the pandemic
or, they need to start repaying student loans again, or they're very high prices of auto
insurance. Right? Things that affect like Day-To-Day, right? Your bills and how you see
things. I think that's where you see some of these parting. I think also it's important to
remember, right? Prices have gone up, the level of prices have gone up. And that's
something that people see every day. Right? The price of gas, the price of eggs, milk,
bread, what you consume every day, every week when you go to the supermarket and
when you go to to the gas station. Right? This is kind of how you you view things. So those
prices have gone up, but wages have also gone up and they have gone up by more than
prices. So I think people will realize that real wages have gone up at some point. They
started seeing that the two things are coming to balance and that is, I think, in part why
maybe sometimes people are not feeling that progress, in their daily lives and they're not
seeing the improvement necessarily.

Don Kohn Yes. Introduce yourself please.

Audience member Well done. Thanks. Rich Miller at Bloomberg. Thank you very much
for doing this. Appreciate it. The Fed seems to have set a fairly high bar for the first rate
cut. Chair Powell said it would be a highly consequential decision. Governor Waller says
the worst thing a big mistake would be to cut and then have to reverse. And and the
FOMC itself says you need greater confidence. Does that suggest that once you clear that
bar, you can move with some alacrity to reduce this, amount of restriction that we see?
Thank you.

Adriana Kugler Thank you for your question, Rich. I, I think it is, something that we're
paying attention to. I would say. That we we don't. We don't actually know. Right?
Because even from now until March, right? We're going to get two new reports on inflation.
We're going to get one new report on jobs. We're going to get another new report on ECI.
So compensation right. We get a lot of new data even between FOMC meetings. So I
would say we we kind of say oh yeah we'll once we card we'll go gradually or we'll cut right
away. It will depend on many factors. I don't think we can call it out now.

Don Kohn Were you part of the median 75 basis point cut in December?

Adriana Kugler You know, I've been at the FOMC for the past four meetings. Yeah. So
that tells you, right?

Don Kohn Okay, perfect. More questions from the audience before I stick my foot in my
mouth. Louise, I I'm there.

Adriana Kugler Right? I mean, I mean, all those meanings that I mean, they said for for
the past two cycles that have included a sub. Yeah.

Audience member I'm Louise Sheiner from the Hutchins Center. Hi. How are you? So
you mentioned sort of thinking about inflation in three buckets, which is how I think about
it. We've got housing, we've got goods, and we've got, services x housing. Are you worried
about the possibility or how would the Fed look at it, that you actually go below target next
year? Because with those pieces, with deflation on goods being higher than it is normally,
it seems quite possible that you might say that underlying inflation is still not quite a target,
but the actual measure, inflation is well below. And would that be a communications
difficulty for you? How would you look at that.

Adriana Kugler So as I said, I think there may be a little bit of a reversal on the good side,
we we don't actually know, but there's some factors that could create upward pressures
and goods inflation. I think the issue is how it averages out. Right? We are thinking, as you
mentioned, about what's measured in what to measure, for example, in housing inflation,
we definitely think it is lower than what it looks like right now, because if you even look at
these research series that the BLS has put out on new tenant rents index, right, that shows
you plus market rents that we made using open sources showed that that's probably lower
than it looks like right now. So we're taking account of all of that. We're definitely looking
at, you know, not only what's measured but what we where we actually expect it to be.

Audience member I'm just saying if because deflation continues at the rate it's been, you
could get an inflation number of, you know, one and a half next year and you might still
say, we're not done. And I'm just wondering about that kind of difficulty of that could arise.

Adriana Kugler We're definitely thinking of that. Yeah. But you know, we I think the whole
issue is that that averages out and they're still reasons why we may expect upside

surprises due to inflation, as well as downside surprises on employment. The risks are
roughly balanced, so we don't know where it will go.

Don Kohn Another question. Yes. The back of the room. Thanks.

Audience member Thank you. Pedro de Costa MNI. So to follow up on Rich's question.
You mentioned we get a lot of data between now and March. Is March a live meeting in
your view? And then secondly, why do you think it's taking so long for shelter inflation to
ebb, given how long? New rental, new lease rentals have been falling.

Adriana Kugler So let me start with this second one. As I mentioned there, these Year-
Long lease agreements. So the way the BLS collects the data on housing inflation, which
feeds both in the CPI and PC, is by by looking at a sample of of renters, they they
interview people every six months. And six of the sample is interviewed every six months.
And then they slowly add people to each of those six of these samples. So it's very slow
moving. That's why they created that other series that I mentioned, the new Tenant Rent
Index, to capture only new renters. So that's that helps to kind of look at actual changes in
prices of this same property, holding everything else constant. Right? So that's one of the
reasons, right, when we look at that new research series that they're creating, when we
look at, market brands that come from other sources, we see something different. We see
a faster decline in housing prices. It's just not coming through the data yet. We think that's
already starting to happen more quickly than it shows up. So can you can you repeat your
first question now?

Audience member [unintelligable]

Adriana Kugler So look, every meeting is life itself. That's the way it goes. We don't make
decisions. So close the door because we will get new information. We have to react to new
conditions. We have to react to information that is coming. And as we are not going to
make a decision now, for a decision for something that is going to be made in seven
weeks from now, certainly March, May, June, every meeting from now until the end of the
year and moving forward will be live. Every meeting is live. Okay.

Don Kohn All right. Yes.

Audience member Okay. Hi. Bryson with [unintelligable]. I'm curious for your thoughts on
the role that wages play inflation. And is it perhaps time to deemphasize how much of that
is a trigger for any potential concerns about the inflation rate? Of the wage price spiral.
And should we? Some would argue that this issue between the Great Recession and now
wages will sort of lagging behind. And then we had the pandemic and you saw this
acceleration in wage growth. But it seemed that inflation was caused by other factors
outside of wages. So do we need to be as concerned about people getting higher wages.

Adriana Kugler So first let me say that real wages are up. No matter what metric you use,
right? Real wages are increasing at 1% if you use ECI. They're increasing at 1.5% and you
use the average hourly earnings. So they're going up. That that is the reason why I
mentioned. Right. If people see that they're going to start demanding lower wages
because they can't keep up with the cost of living. That's really important. So that will that
will continue to plain until we're more into balance, right? Of course there are other factors.
I would say we have not seen a wage prices spiral. I would say we have not seen that type
of dynamic. And I described that in my speech. I just don't think that actually happening
that way this time around. And that was managed through, inflation expectations.

Precisely. Right. Both. Firms businesses are realizing, well, they cannot keep posting
prices at that level because consumers will push back. And by the same token, workers
are realizing, well, my salary is now above what it was to sustain my cost of living, my
usual cost of living. And so that's that's something that, you know, makes me think that I
can. Not butch, but it's this much pressure in terms of of increasing, asking for higher
salaries and wages and that that is happening. And we hear stories like that.

Don Kohn All right. I think that we're about out of time. So thank you, Governor Kugler.
Thank you very much. Thank you Don. Feel free to come back anytime. We do. Happy to
welcome you again. Thank you. Thank.
