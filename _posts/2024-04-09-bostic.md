title: Atlanta Fed's Bostic Expects Slower Economic Growth, One Rate Cut in Q4
categories: Fedspeak
tags: [policy, Bostic]
article_excerpt: "In an exclusive interview, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he expects the US economy to slow, 'but not nearly as much as I had anticipated, say, in January.' Despite the economy's resilience, Bostic maintains his outlook for 'one rate cut' in the fourth quarter, stating, 'at this point, I think it's one.' However, he acknowledged balanced risks, noting that 'given that the US economy has been so robust, and so strong, and so resilient, you can't take off the possibility that the rate cuts may even have to move further out.' Bostic expects inflation 'is only going to come down at a very slow pace through the course of this year.' He pointed out that while 'goods inflation has come down very fast,' it's 'on the services side that we've seen the struggles in terms of inflation persistently being higher than it usually is.' Regarding the labor market, Bostic said recent job growth has been 'pretty broad based.' He noted that businesses 'are feeling like they have less pricing power' compared to a year ago, which could constrain inflation."

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Investors only pricing in around two rate cuts this year on the back of stronger than expected economic data.</span> <span class="neutral bold">That's down from the median of three cuts that Fed officials have penciled in.</span> <span class="neutral">My next guest though only expects one rate cut this year and he doesn't expect it until the fourth quarter.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">Joining me now in an exclusive interview is Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic.</span> <span class="neutral">President Bostic, welcome back to the program.</span> <span class="neutral">It's so great to have you.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Thank you.</span> <span class="neutral">It's really good to see you as well, Jennifer.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Great to see you as well, President Bostic.</span> <span class="neutral bold">This economic data continues to come in strong none other than that jobs report on Friday.</span> <span class="neutral bold">For the month of March, the Fed already lifting its outlook for growth this year.</span> <span class="neutral">What is the prospect that we could see the outlook for growth upgraded again?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, you know, I think it's always possible.</span> <span class="neutral">But let me just start by saying, look, the US economy has been incredibly resilient and it's been strong.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">And it's been strong for the better part of eight or nine months.</span></p>

<p><span class="dovish">My outlook a year ago was that the economy would be slowing down and would not be performing at the level that it is, and that inflation would be coming down gradually but not nearly as strong as it has.</span> <span class="neutral bold">So right now, I'm actually very grateful that the economy is producing a lot of jobs, that output is up, that wages are up.</span> <span class="neutral">These are all good things and bode well for the economy.</span></p>

<p><span class="hawkish bold">Moving forward, my outlook is still that the economy will slow, but not nearly as much as I had anticipated, say, in January.</span> <span class="neutral">And we'll just have to see how it goes, but for now this is all very good news.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: How are you viewing the job market now, especially in light of that stronger than expected jobs report on Friday, particularly wage growth?</span> <span class="neutral">Do you think this economy can continue adding jobs at this pace without adding upward pressure to inflation?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, we'll have to see how this jobs report looks relative to the next several that happen.</span> <span class="neutral">As you know, there's volatility in these numbers all the time and the last report was certainly a surprise to the upside.</span> <span class="neutral">But there are a couple of things that I've been watching as we've been seeing and tracking employment over the last several months.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">One is, which sectors are producing the jobs.</span> <span class="neutral">And historically, job growth has been broad based.</span> <span class="neutral bold">But over the last six to eight months, a disproportionate amount of job growth has happened in the governmental sector and in the health care sector.</span> <span class="neutral">And these are two sectors that through the pandemic have been lagging their long-term average.</span> <span class="neutral">So there is some catch up that's happening.</span></p>

<p><span class="hawkish bold">But I also have to acknowledge that the last couple of reports have been pretty broad based in terms of growth and we've been trying to figure out exactly what that means.</span> <span class="neutral">I think one of the things that we have looked to is a robust response on the supply side.</span> <span class="neutral">Workers are coming back into the economy, as well as a lot of the supply chains.</span> <span class="neutral">They've, kind of, totally opened up and they're able to function in ways that allow the response to the elevated demand to be quite strong.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Tomorrow, we're going to get CPI for the month of March.</span> <span class="neutral">Expectations are for 3.7% on core year over year, 3/10 of a percent increase month over month.</span> <span class="neutral">Looking at that year over year, that'd be down about a tenth of a percent from 3.8 in February and down from about 3.9 in both January and December.</span> <span class="neutral">If that number were to come in line with expectations, how would you view that?</span> <span class="neutral">Would it give you any encouragement that some of the hotter inflation prints that we saw in the first couple of months of this year were due more to seasonality?</span></p>

<p><span class="dovish">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, look, a number coming in where the financial participants expect would be a welcome development.</span> <span class="dovish">It would suggest that inflation is continuing to move closer to our target and that's a good thing.</span> <span class="neutral">I'll say for me, my outlook has always been that through this year, we would see some bumpiness in the trajectory of inflation.</span> <span class="hawkish">Certainly, my outlook has us moving closer to 2%, but not necessarily in a particularly fast way.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">So the numbers coming in, as you suggest they might tomorrow, would be welcome.</span> <span class="neutral">But it just says that we've got to keep watching and make sure that that pathway continues.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">Because there is some evidence to suggest in the first two months of this year that perhaps inflation's trajectory was stalling out a bit and wasn't moving as clearly to that 2% target.</span> <span class="dovish">So a return to the more clear evidence of that would be a good thing.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">To me, I think it would still though be consistent with my outlook, which says that inflation is only going to come down at a very slow pace through the course of this year.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: To your point, you look at housing inflation, that's been slow to come down.</span> <span class="neutral">We've seen evidence of that in CPI particularly.</span> <span class="neutral">And inventory for housing is quite low.</span> <span class="neutral">That's not expected to change anytime soon.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">At the same time, we're discussing how strong the job market is.</span> <span class="neutral">I wonder about services inflation.</span> <span class="neutral">What is the risk that inflation could stall here or even reverse course?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, it's something that we're watching very closely.</span> <span class="dovish bold">As you know, goods inflation has come down very fast and it's basically at pre-pandemic levels.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">But it's on the services side that we've seen the struggles in terms of inflation persistently being higher than it usually is.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">Now, some of that is because salaries don't adjust on a month-to-month basis but rather year over year.</span> <span class="hawkish">But some of it is that demand for a lot of services is still quite high.</span> <span class="neutral">We're just going to have to monitor this moving forward.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">What I would say is that when I talk to my business contacts through the southeastern United States, what they're telling me is a story that gives me some confidence.</span> <span class="dovish">One is that demand is starting to slow.</span> <span class="neutral">It's not slowing rapidly, but it is moving in the right direction and one that's consistent with what I would expect if we're going to get to that 2% target over time.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">A second is that they're pretty confident that they're going to be able to retain their labor force and they're not looking to lay off a lot of people.</span> <span class="neutral">And that's quite positive as well.</span> <span class="dovish bold">But the third thing that is quite important and relevant in this context is that most of them are feeling like they have less pricing power than they had, say, a year ago or 18 months ago.</span> <span class="dovish">Their ability to pass through price increases, they tell me, is much weaker than it was before.</span> <span class="dovish">And I think that is going to put some constraint on the degree to which inflation can start to move in that other direction.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">Now, of course, that's what they've told me the last three or four months.</span> <span class="neutral">I've got to make sure that that's what they continue to tell me as the next few months happen and we move into the summer where people start going on vacations and taking their trips.</span> <span class="neutral">It'll be an important time and an important data point to keep track of.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: To your point, President Bostic, I mean, you've only penciled in one rate cut for this year.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">You don't see it happening until the fourth quarter.</span> <span class="neutral bold">Given what you just mentioned, given the strength of the job market, what is the prospect of not cutting rates at all this year?</span> <span class="neutral">How realistic of a scenario is that things get pushed back into 2025?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, you know, I actually think that the risks are somewhat balanced relative to where my outlook is.</span> <span class="hawkish">So that would say that the economy could accelerate in ways that mean that we have an ability to be more patient even than we are right now or the economy could slow.</span> <span class="dovish">You know, I keep trying to remind myself that over the last six months of 2023, inflation moved far more robustly than I expected.</span> <span class="neutral">And that possibility is still out there.</span></p>

<p><span class="dovish">And if that declining-- that pace of decline resumes, it could be the case that I will view pulling forward my inflation outlook and my policy outlook so that we're cutting rates sooner may come to pass.</span> <span class="neutral">Ultimately, it will just depend on what the data show, but I do think the risks are balanced.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">And given that the US economy has been so robust, and so strong, and so resilient, you can't take off the possibility that the rate cuts may even have to move further out.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: If you do pull forward your forecast, would that mean that you could see more than one rate cut on the table this year?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: It's possible.</span> <span class="dovish">Look, in the last SCP, our dot-plot submission, I had two cuts for this year because I had taken on board the rapid decline of inflation through the past-- through that last six months of 2023.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">What happened for me is that it slowed down and the pace went back to the pace that I had expected initially, which had me at one cut.</span> <span class="neutral">So you know, I'm open to whatever the data tells us.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">However the economy evolves, that will govern and guide what I think the appropriate path of policy is.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">And at this point, I think it's one.</span> <span class="neutral">But as months pass, I may move to two or I might move to zero.</span> <span class="neutral">And we'll just have to see where the chips fall.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: You mentioned earlier in the interview that if CPI were to come in with expectations, that would be welcome.</span> <span class="neutral">How many more prints of CPI, PCE moving in that direction would you need to see to become fully confident that inflation is moving back to begin initiating those rate cuts?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: So that's a really hard question to answer.</span> <span class="neutral">I mean, on some level, it depends on the degree to which the numbers come in on point.</span> <span class="neutral">Do they come stronger than expected or weaker than expected?</span> <span class="neutral">And so it's really hard to know.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">What I would say, though, is that in addition to the top line number, I'm actually looking at a number of other things as well.</span> <span class="neutral">So as, you know, the top line number is sort of the average or aggregate of the changes in prices of all the goods in the basket.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">But what our team does in Atlanta is we also break it down and say, OK, if you go item by item in the basket, what share of the basket is showing price increases greater than 3% or price increases greater than 5%?</span> <span class="hawkish bold">Because if you have a lot of goods at 5%, it's hard to get to 2%.</span></p>

<p><span class="hawkish bold">And what we're seeing right now is that the distribution, if you look at the distribution of price increases, there are far many at the 5% level or higher than what we typically see in a normal time.</span> <span class="hawkish">And as long as that distribution is showing that latent price pressure, we're going to have to be mindful of that and pay attention.</span> <span class="neutral">So I'm looking at a number of other things and I'll really want the totality of those measures to be telling me that we're getting back to a normalized level where 2% is likely to happen.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Really quick before I let you go, President Bostic, on the other side of your mandate, the unemployment side.</span> <span class="neutral">How high would unemployment need to go up assuming that inflation is, kind of, at these levels, maybe a little bit lower but not at your 2% target, for you to cut rates?</span> <span class="neutral">Is there a certain level that the unemployment rate would need to rise to?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: So you know, I don't have a certain level in mind on this.</span> <span class="neutral">What I'm really trying to make sure is that we get to our 2% target with as little damage on the employment side as possible.</span> <span class="neutral">And right now, I'm not hearing from businesses that they're expecting very much damage, if any at all, and that's quite comforting.</span></p>

<p><span class="dovish">If I started to get different signals to suggest that there is a lot of coming pain in the labor market side, then I'd be open to changing our policy stance and perhaps cutting sooner.</span> <span class="neutral">But it's hard to know exactly what number I would need to see.</span> <span class="neutral">It would really be about, sort of, what I'm hearing and how I'm hearing business leaders across sectors and our geography feel about the labor market.</span> <span class="dovish">And if it seems like there's a looming cliff that's coming, I'll definitely have to take that on board and thinking about when it is going to be appropriate to reduce rates.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: President Bostic, thank you so much for your insight so appreciate it.</span> <span class="neutral">Let's not wait so long again to have you back.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">RAPHAEL BOSTIC: I'll be looking for the invitation.</span> <span class="neutral">It's been great to talk with you.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral">JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Thanks so much.</span> <span class="neutral">That's Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta Federal Reserve.</span></p>
