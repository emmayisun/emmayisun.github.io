#### Goolsbee

**On dot:** *"No, I'm not one of the extremes on that. I'm closer to the median. "*

#### Bostic
[12/15/2023]("https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-feds-bostic-sees-two-180709304.html?guccounter=1")

**2 cuts in 2H'24.** core PCE for 2024 -> 2.4%(median). sounds cautious but clearly would jump to cut if job's weak.

joined Williams to push back on market pricing by saying *"Well, I’m actually where John is on this. For me pulling forward, the time when we would consider dropping rates is really still Quarter 3 of 2024. That’s in my outlook, that’s what I have in mind if inflation proceeds as I expect it will. So yeah, there’s plenty of time. I, I’m not looking for anything or expecting anything imminent to happen."*

#### Daly

**said she's close to the median** sounds dovish overall... but the benchmark for the committee is shifting to dovish anyways.
