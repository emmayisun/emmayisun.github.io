***Editor's note: This quick note is written by a human analyst, not the Fedbot*** **:)**

The Federal Reserve [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240124a.htm) at 7 p.m. on Wednesday that the [Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP)](https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/GeneralPages/bank_term_funding_program) will conclude as scheduled on March 11, 2024. This decision follows earlier indications by Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision [Michael Barr](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-considering-changes-basel-proposal-supervision-chief-2024-01-09/) and New York Fed President [John Williams](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-11/use-of-fed-funding-tool-hits-fresh-peak-as-officials-signal-end) on January 11. BPI's Bill Nelson has [posited](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/forward-guidance-why-did-fed-announce-changes-btfp-7-pm-bill-nelson-vnhie%3FtrackingId=7tkRcXwWQG6srEOw4g8Ucw%253D%253D/?trackingId=7tkRcXwWQG6srEOw4g8Ucw%3D%3D) several reasons for the interesting timing of the press release.

In addition to this [announcement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20240124a.htm), the Fed has increased the rate on new loans made through the BTFP from now until March 11th. Advances under the BTFP will now be at the one-year Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate plus 10 basis points, but [not lower than](https://www.federalreserve.gov/financial-stability/files/bank-term-funding-program-faqs.pdf) the Interest Rate on Reserve Balances (IORB) effective that day. This [adjustment](https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/-/media/Documents/BTFP_docs/BTFP-rates.xlsx?sc_lang=en&hash=56E259A1F195098FF830DB3DE6CC7E41) marks a significant increase, from 4.88% on January 24, 2024, to 5.40% on January 25, 2024. The increase effectively eliminates the arbitrage opportunity that had recently driven a surge in BTFP usage([Figure 1](#chart1)).

According to the [FAQ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/financial-stability/files/bank-term-funding-program-faqs.pdf#page=9) provided by the Fed, under section 11(s) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Reserve will also publicly disclose information concerning the Program **one year** after it ends.
