#### Q&A 
<p><b>Arvin Murphy:</b> <span id="sentence-1" data-timestamp="10:11" class="neutral">Thanks, thank you very much, Chair, for those remarks and for taking some time to be with us and talk to us today.</span> <span id="sentence-2" data-timestamp="10:20" class="neutral">There's a lot of stuff going on in the world today. I think we have a lot of stuff to talk about, so I'm going to get right into it.</span> <span id="sentence-3" data-timestamp="10:29" class="neutral">Before I get started, I just want to also thank you to the audience for sending questions over.</span> <span id="sentence-4" data-timestamp="10:36" class="neutral">What I've done is I've tried to organize the conversation around two themes: one, we'll start by talking about the macroeconomy, and then you have been shared through a very tumultuous period over the last 5 years, and I want to talk about the leadership challenges around that.</span></p>

<p><b>Arvin Murphy:</b> <span id="sentence-5" data-timestamp="10:51" class="neutral">Let me just dive right into it, pick up on something you started talking about, which is inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-6" data-timestamp="10:56" class="neutral bold">Two years ago, we had inflation readings close to 6-7%. We've come down to 3%. Last Friday, the PCE inflation index, the personal consumption expenditure inflation index, which is something the Fed often speaks about, came at 2.8%.</span> <span id="sentence-7" data-timestamp="11:14" class="neutral">We had, we have, we've had a conversation about this. There's so many factors that have been play in the economy over the last couple years. I wonder if you can just spend a some time talking to us about what do you think are the key factors that have brought inflation down over the last two years?</span></p>

<p><b>Chair Powell:</b> <span id="sentence-8" data-timestamp="11:32" class="neutral">Sure, so I think I'll start with where we think the inflation came from, so what is actually different this time, at the risk of making that statement.</span> <span id="sentence-9" data-timestamp="11:43" class="hawkish bold">This inflation wasn't strictly just a question of demand overheating and the Fed coming in and having to suppress demand. That's been the more typical pattern, perhaps on the back of a shock such as oil price shock and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="sentence-10" data-timestamp="12:00" class="dovish bold">This episode actually also involved, as everyone will recall, the collapse of the supply side in a lot of ways.</span> <span id="sentence-11" data-timestamp="12:07" class="dovish bold">Supply chains stopped working. There were shortages of critical things like semiconductors, which turned out you couldn't make cars. I think many of us might not have realized how many semiconductors go into a car.</span> <span id="sentence-12" data-timestamp="12:21" class="dovish bold">In addition, there was a major labor force shock, so we lost several million people out of the labor market, so that we had a very severe labor shortage.</span> <span id="sentence-13" data-timestamp="12:31" class="hawkish bold">So it was a supply side issue as well as overheated demand from the closing and then reopening of the economy at a time when rates were low and fiscal policy was very supportive of demand.</span> <span id="sentence-14" data-timestamp="12:47" class="dovish">So we had both of those things, and therefore, if those were the causes, what we needed to see was both the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand in the economy and also the effects of monetary policy.</span> <span id="sentence-15" data-timestamp="13:04" class="dovish bold">So today, what we think we're seeing as inflation has come down sharply over the last year is those two factors working together, and they do work together. We think that tight monetary policy weighing on demand actually gives the supply side better chance to recover, and 2023, of course, was a year, as I mentioned, of very significant supply side recovery and expansion.</span></p>

<p><b>Arvin Murphy:</b> <span id="sentence-16" data-timestamp="13:26" class="neutral">What are the factors that you're keeping an eye on, say, over the next few years, maybe next year or two, that might play out in the inflation picture?</span></p>

<p><b>Chair Powell:</b> <span id="sentence-17" data-timestamp="13:37" class="neutral bold">I should also mention inflation expectations, which in our framework and in the thinking of most monetary economists, people think that having the public expect inflation to return to 2%, despite it moving up, that that's a very important factor in bringing inflation back down.</span> <span id="sentence-18" data-timestamp="13:55" class="neutral bold">In a sense, if people believe that price setters and wage setters in the economy, if they believe that inflation will be 2%, then that'll actually happen.</span> <span id="sentence-19" data-timestamp="14:07" class="neutral">So as we look ahead though, one question is how much more juice is there to come out of the supply side recovery.</span> <span id="sentence-20" data-timestamp="14:16" class="dovish">We also got a very large increase in population last year, which may have helped with inflation. It certainly helped with output and increased the potential output.</span> <span id="sentence-21" data-timestamp="14:30" class="dovish bold">At the same time, the economy is growing 3.1% last year, around that. We also had inflation coming down sharply.</span> <span id="sentence-22" data-timestamp="14:40" class="dovish">So there may be more supply side gains to be had. Surveys of business still show difficulties in hiring people, different difficulties in getting the inputs that they need for their businesses, so there's some more benefit there.</span> <span id="sentence-23" data-timestamp="14:56" class="hawkish bold">We also think that monetary policy is tight. It's weighing on interest-sensitive spending in the economy. So for example, durable goods surveys of consumers will say that it's a tough time to buy durable goods because rates are high.</span> <span id="sentence-24" data-timestamp="15:11" class="dovish bold">You also see the labor market rebalancing because you can look at demand in the labor market as well as supply, but you see demand reflected in lower job openings, a very small increase in unemployment, in wages moving back down toward more sustainable levels.</span> <span id="sentence-25" data-timestamp="15:29" class="neutral bold">So we think those two forces that I mentioned will be the ones we'll be looking for, and the thing we'll be looking at, of course, is the incoming data on inflation as those affect the outlook and the same thing about about the labor market. What's happening in the labor market? Does it suggest that the labor market is continuing its progress, and it's made substantial progress to get back to a sustainable level of wage growth and balance between supply and demand.</span></p>

<p><b>Arvin Murphy:</b> <span id="sentence-26" data-timestamp="15:57" class="neutral">Can I just dig into the inflation expectations point you mentioned?</span> <span id="sentence-27" data-timestamp="16:03" class="neutral">The analogy that people drew a couple years ago was to the high inflation episode of the 70s, where we had a high inflation period that then ended up shifting expectations and, through the wage price mechanism, ended up leading to a sustained period of high inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-28" data-timestamp="16:19" class="neutral">In the current situation, I guess I two questions: how concerned are you about maybe inflation getting stuck in the upper twos, around three? Could that last mile be very hard because inflation expectations getting stuck?</span> <span id="sentence-29" data-timestamp="16:36" class="neutral">And then relatedly, are there things you're looking at to tell you, to signal to you, that that is an issue or isn't an issue?</span></p>

<p><b>Chair Powell:</b> <span id="sentence-30" data-timestamp="16:45" class="neutral bold">Right, so as I mentioned, inflation expectations, we think, are an important part of driving actual inflation, and we want them to be at levels that are consistent with 2% inflation over time, not 3%, but 2%, not 2 and a half percent.</span> <span id="sentence-31" data-timestamp="17:01" class="dovish bold">The good news is that that's where they are right now and pretty much have been for some time, and we look at surveys of businesses, households, forecasters. We look at other kinds of measures of inflation expectations, model based and things like that.</span> <span id="sentence-32" data-timestamp="17:18" class="dovish bold">We also look at market based. The market is always buying and selling inflation protection, and you can get from that expectation of or assessment of what markets expect, and all of those are pretty consistently saying that the public does believe, and it's a good thing because it's true, that inflation will go back down to 2%.</span> <span id="sentence-33" data-timestamp="17:42" class="hawkish bold">So that's very assuring, but that's partly because of the very strong action that we took and also because of our ongoing commitment to actually return inflation to 2% over time.</span> <span id="sentence-34" data-timestamp="17:55" class="neutral">And that is our commitment, by the way. We're, but over time.</span> <span id="sentence-35" data-timestamp="18:02" class="neutral">So I would say it would be a concern if inflation expectations were not to be consistent with the outcome that we seek, but the good news is they're not, and I think our commitment is understood and respected and believed by the public, and that's as it should be.</span></p>

<p><b>Arvin Murphy:</b> <span id="sentence-36" data-timestamp="18:21" class="neutral">Let me flip to the other side of the equation. We've had employment, economic activity that remained quite strong. The unemployment rate is really, it's remained below 4% for the last 2 years, and this is during a period in which you've took the funds rate from 0% to 5.3% in about as fast a rate hike cycle as we've seen in history.</span> <span id="sentence-37" data-timestamp="18:45" class="neutral">A year ago, many people were talking about possibility of recession. That hasn't happened.</span> <span id="sentence-38" data-timestamp="18:51" class="neutral">Again, you made some remarks about this, but I wonder if you can just go a little bit more into this. Why hasn't this happened? Why have we achieved what looks like a soft landing, which is inflation coming down, unemployment remaining low? What are the factors that have played out?</span> <span id="sentence-39" data-timestamp="19:09" class="neutral">And then the related question: do we think this will continue to happen over the next year or two?</span></p>

<p><b>Chair Powell:</b> <span id="sentence-40" data-timestamp="19:16" class="neutral">Yeah, so I guess it's, I've always had the view and always said that because of the unusual origins of this inflation and its differences from other prior episodes, there was a path to getting inflation back down, restoring price stability, get inflation back down sustainably to 2% without the kind of large job losses and increases in unemployment that have been typical of prior tightening cycles.</span> <span id="sentence-41" data-timestamp="19:44" class="dovish bold">And the reason again was that some part of this was independent of demand.</span> <span id="sentence-42" data-timestamp="19:50" class="hawkish bold">When, if you have to get all of the inflation reduction gains from suppressing demand, then the chances are that that will involve, that will weigh on employment and economic activity pretty significantly.</span> <span id="sentence-43" data-timestamp="20:06" class="dovish bold">But here we had the situation for tack against semiconductors. You couldn't buy a car at the very time when people wanted cars because they were moving to the suburbs, because they didn't want to ride on public transportation because of COVID. At that precise time, the supply of cars went down dramatically because of this shortage.</span> <span id="sentence-44" data-timestamp="20:26" class="hawkish">So what happened is the prices went way up. That's how the market clears in our economy.</span> <span id="sentence-45" data-timestamp="20:32" class="dovish bold">So on the other side of that though, without respect to demand, once this semiconductor supply comes back, you should come right back down that curve, and you could, in principle, get</span></p>
