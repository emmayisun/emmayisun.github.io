title: Fed's Waller Sees No Rush to Cut Rates Despite Progress on Inflation
categories: Fedspeak
tags: [policy, QT, Waller]
article_excerpt: "In a recent speech, Fed Governor Christopher Waller expressed uncertainty about the pace of continued progress on inflation, citing recent hot inflation data. He stated, 'until that progress materializes, I am not ready to take that step' to cut rates, and 'in the absence of an unexpected and material deterioration in the real economy, I'm going to need to see at least a couple of months of better inflation data before I have enough confidence that beginning to cut rates will keep the economy on a path to 2% inflation.' Waller noted that the strong labor market means 'the risk of waiting a little longer to ease policy is small,' and emphasized 'no urgency in taking the step of beginning to ease monetary policy.' He sees the economy continuing to grow at a healthy pace while the labor market remains tight."

<p><span id="sentence-1" data-timestamp="00:00" class="neutral">All right let me get set up here a second.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-2" data-timestamp="00:04" class="neutral">All right thank you Barbara and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.</span> <span id="sentence-3" data-timestamp="00:10" class="neutral">My subject as it often is, is the outlook for the US economy and how that affects the Federal Open Market Committee's or FOMC's continuing effort to reduce inflation to a sustained level of 2% while maintaining a healthy labor market.</span> <span id="sentence-4" data-timestamp="00:33" class="dovish bold">We made a lot of headway toward our inflation goal in 2023 and the labor market moved substantially into better balance, all while holding the unemployment rate below 4% for nearly two years.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-5" data-timestamp="00:52" class="hawkish bold">But the data we have received so far this year has made me uncertain about the speed of our continued progress.</span> <span id="sentence-6" data-timestamp="01:00" class="hawkish bold">Back in February, I noted that data on fourth quarter gross domestic product or GDP as well as January data on job growth and inflation came in hotter than expected.</span> <span id="sentence-7" data-timestamp="01:14" class="hawkish bold">I concluded then that we needed time to verify that the progress on inflation we saw in the second half of 2023 would continue, and that there was no rush to begin cutting interest rates to normalize the stance of monetary policy.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-8" data-timestamp="01:33" class="hawkish bold">Over the past month, additional economic data has reinforced this view.</span> <span id="sentence-9" data-timestamp="01:38" class="hawkish bold">February job gains moved back up to 275,000, making the three-month average a strong 265,000 a month.</span> <span id="sentence-10" data-timestamp="01:49" class="hawkish bold">Various inflation measures have continued to come in hot.</span> <span id="sentence-11" data-timestamp="01:54" class="hawkish bold">Core personal consumption expenditures or PCE inflation jumped to 0.4% on a monthly basis in January after averaging around 0.1% in October through December of last year.</span> <span id="sentence-12" data-timestamp="02:09" class="hawkish bold">With February Consumer Price Index or CPI and Producer Price Index inflation data already in hand, some forecasts are predicting core PCE inflation may be revised up from 0.4% in January and is expected to come in at 0.3% for February, which we'll learn about on Friday.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-13" data-timestamp="02:33" class="hawkish bold">Now adding this new data to what we saw earlier in the year reinforces my view that there is no rush to cut the policy rate.</span> <span id="sentence-14" data-timestamp="02:43" class="most-hawkish bold">Indeed, it tells me that it is prudent to hold this rate at its current restrictive stance perhaps for longer than previously thought to keep inflation on a sustainable trajectory toward 2%.</span> <span id="sentence-15" data-timestamp="02:57" class="dovish bold">I continue to believe that further progress will make it appropriate for the FOMC to begin reducing the target range for the federal funds rate this year.</span> <span id="sentence-16" data-timestamp="03:07" class="hawkish bold">But until that progress materializes, I am not ready to take that step.</span> <span id="sentence-17" data-timestamp="03:13" class="dovish bold">Fortunately, the strength of the U.S. economy and resilience of the labor market mean the risk of waiting a little longer to ease policy is small and significantly lower than acting too soon and possibly squandering our progress on inflation.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-18" data-timestamp="03:32" class="neutral">Now turning to the performance of the U.S. economy, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model, based on all current data, predicts first quarter growth in real GDP of 2.1% at an annual rate.</span> <span id="sentence-19" data-timestamp="03:47" class="neutral">Similarly, the consensus from the Blue Chip survey of private sector forecasters is 2%.</span> <span id="sentence-20" data-timestamp="03:54" class="hawkish">Now this would be a significant slowdown from the average of around 4% in the second half of 2023 but still quite solid growth.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-21" data-timestamp="04:06" class="neutral">Consumer spending, the largest component of GDP, seems to be moderating this quarter.</span> <span id="sentence-22" data-timestamp="04:12" class="hawkish">Retail sales fell significantly in January and then retraced about half of that decline in February.</span> <span id="sentence-23" data-timestamp="04:20" class="hawkish">Smoothing out these swings, they clearly indicate a moderation in goods spending from the second half of last year.</span> <span id="sentence-24" data-timestamp="04:28" class="neutral">However, services spending, excluding energy, grew moderately in January, which offset to some extent the decline in goods spending.</span> <span id="sentence-25" data-timestamp="04:39" class="neutral">I'll be watching on Friday morning to see what the February data on personal income and spending show.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-26" data-timestamp="04:48" class="neutral">Now on the business side, surveys of purchasing managers in February continue to report results we've been hearing for over a year.</span> <span id="sentence-27" data-timestamp="04:57" class="hawkish">For manufacturers, the Institute for Supply Management indicated a slight contraction in activity, with new orders and production moving down a bit.</span> <span id="sentence-28" data-timestamp="05:09" class="neutral">This contrasts with non-manufacturing businesses that continue to see expansion in activity, with measures of new orders and business activity on the higher end of their readings over the past year.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-29" data-timestamp="05:26" class="hawkish bold">Now let me turn to the labor market. The data is sending a mixed message on how supply and demand are evolving.</span> <span id="sentence-30" data-timestamp="05:35" class="hawkish bold">As I noted earlier, payroll data estimate that employers added 275,000 jobs in February.</span> <span id="sentence-31" data-timestamp="05:44" class="hawkish bold">This robust gain is not only above the 265,000 average level of job creation since November, but also is above the 251,000 monthly average for all of 2023.</span> <span id="sentence-32" data-timestamp="05:59" class="hawkish bold">Recent gains have been broad-based across sectors rather than concentrated in just a few sectors, which may be a sign that demand is not moderating as much as needed to support continued progress in inflation.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-33" data-timestamp="06:18" class="neutral">Conversely, the household survey estimated that the unemployment rate rose to 3.9% in February, but that increase was driven mostly by an outsized rise in the number of 16 to 24 year olds counted as unemployed.</span> <span id="sentence-34" data-timestamp="06:36" class="neutral">Youth employment tends to be quite volatile, so this rate may drop back in the next few months, and if so, pull the overall unemployment rate back down as well.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-35" data-timestamp="06:50" class="dovish bold">A sign of loosening in the labor market is that the number of people quitting their jobs has fallen below the levels just before the pandemic.</span> <span id="sentence-36" data-timestamp="07:02" class="neutral">I believe most workers quit their jobs for better pay or benefits. It doesn't make a lot of sense to quit your job to take a worse job.</span> <span id="sentence-37" data-timestamp="07:13" class="dovish bold">So less turnover means firms do not need to enhance their compensation packages to attract workers, and this is consistent with anecdotal evidence we're hearing of easing wage pressures.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-38" data-timestamp="07:28" class="hawkish bold">The most recent data suggests nominal wage growth has continued to ease, but most of these measures are still above their pre-pandemic levels.</span> <span id="sentence-39" data-timestamp="07:39" class="hawkish bold">And considering overall compensation, which includes wages and benefits, here too growth has slowed but remains elevated.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-40" data-timestamp="07:51" class="neutral bold">Looking across various indicators of labor demand, there hasn't been much change in recent months.</span> <span id="sentence-41" data-timestamp="07:58" class="hawkish bold">Job openings drifted down all through last year but then have flattened out recently at a still elevated level, while the pace of hiring is close to its pre-pandemic level.</span> <span id="sentence-42" data-timestamp="08:12" class="hawkish bold">With strong labor supply and little apparent change in demand in recent months, the ratio of vacancies to people looking for work has been roughly flat after declining significantly in 2023.</span> <span id="sentence-43" data-timestamp="08:28" class="hawkish bold">At 1.4 jobs for each person looking, that ratio is down from 2022's peak of around 2 and indicates that the labor market has loosened up over the last two years. But the vacancies-to-unemployed ratio is still higher than the 1.2 that prevailed before the pandemic and has held steady around 1.4 for several months.</span> <span id="sentence-44" data-timestamp="08:56" class="hawkish bold">This suggests that the labor market still remains tight.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-45" data-timestamp="09:05" class="neutral">Now let me turn to a topic related to the labor market that has important implications for the longer-term course of the U.S. economy: productivity.</span> <span id="sentence-46" data-timestamp="09:17" class="neutral">When productivity across the economy grows quickly, it means that output and income can also grow quickly without putting upward pressure on inflation. So it supports rising living standards.</span> <span id="sentence-47" data-timestamp="09:32" class="neutral">And lately, productivity has been growing fast. Over the final three quarters of 2023, it grew at a pace a bit under 4%, much faster than the average growth rate of productivity since the 1970s.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-48" data-timestamp="09:50" class="neutral">Now some have argued that this must be why we had such strong economic growth in 2023 even while inflation was slowing. Perhaps, they say, we are at the start of another era of fast and sustained productivity growth, such as the United States experienced from 1998 through 2004.</span> <span id="sentence-49" data-timestamp="10:12" class="neutral">Now believe me, I hope this is all true, because it would be the basis for broadly shared prosperity that raises living standards.</span> <span id="sentence-50" data-timestamp="10:23" class="neutral">But I am skeptical that it will last.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-51" data-timestamp="10:29" class="neutral">The first thing to note is that productivity growth is notoriously volatile. Though productivity grew fast for the final nine months of last year, it actually fell in the first quarter of 2023, and rather substantially for all of 2022.</span> <span id="sentence-52" data-timestamp="10:48" class="neutral">So one may view this recent fast growth as simply making up for earlier declines.</span> <span id="sentence-53" data-timestamp="10:55" class="neutral">In fact, smoothing across the past two years, productivity growth averages a bit above 1.25% annually.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-54" data-timestamp="11:07" class="neutral">Also keep in mind that periods of fast productivity growth that last more than a few years are unusual, and it is also difficult to be sure what the causes are.</span> <span id="sentence-55" data-timestamp="11:20" class="neutral">So when thinking about productivity, one has to distinguish between factors that raise productivity in the short run but ultimately are one-off increases in the level of productivity, as opposed to those things that increase the long-run growth rate of productivity so that the level of productivity is constantly rising.</span></p> 

<p><span id="sentence-56" data-timestamp="11:45" class="neutral">So let me pause at several factors that have been suggested for explaining the recent increase in productivity and try to place them in the one-off or the long-run buckets.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-57" data-timestamp="11:59" class="neutral">Now many people point to recent large investment projects in the United States, such as those associated with the Inflation Reduction Act or artificial intelligence, as boosting productivity.</span> <span id="sentence-58" data-timestamp="12:13" class="neutral">But these investments will take place over many years and may not have done much yet to add to the nation's productive capacity.</span> <span id="sentence-59" data-timestamp="12:23" class="neutral">I mean, most firms I talk to about AI say "We're playing around with it, we're exploring, we're trying to see how we could use it." It's not showing up in their current output and productivity.</span> <span id="sentence-60" data-timestamp="12:41" class="neutral">So it is possible that these things could increase longer-run productivity growth. It remains to be seen if they will.</span> <span id="sentence-61" data-timestamp="12:50" class="neutral">They are unlikely to explain the recent rise in productivity growth.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-62" data-timestamp="12:57" class="neutral">The recent surge in business startups after a sustained lull has also been mentioned as a factor.</span> <span id="sentence-63" data-timestamp="13:05" class="neutral">Like the investment projects, it may be causing a boost to productivity, but it's likely to occur over a number of years.</span> <span id="sentence-64" data-timestamp="13:15" class="neutral">And unless the current boom in new business formation continues into the future, once again, this factor will at best raise the level of productivity over the short term and not the long-run growth rate.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-65" data-timestamp="13:32" class="neutral">Another factor that is often pointed to is the resolution of supply chain problems.</span> <span id="sentence-66" data-timestamp="13:39" class="neutral">But once the supply chain issues are resolved, this boost to productivity growth will end.</span> <span id="sentence-67" data-timestamp="13:46" class="neutral">So this is clearly a short-run factor that will simply raise the level of productivity but not the long-run growth rate.</span> <span id="sentence-68" data-timestamp="13:56" class="neutral">If supply chains lowered productivity, resolving them just brings it back up, but it doesn't cause long-run productivity growth.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-69" data-timestamp="14:08" class="neutral">Another potential cause of recent productivity growth is that the pandemic changed how we work and use technology.</span> <span id="sentence-70" data-timestamp="14:18" class="neutral">I've heard this many, many times.</span> <span id="sentence-71" data-timestamp="14:22" class="neutral">Well, I certainly can see how this would affect the level of productivity in the short run, once we have made those adjustments in the way that we work, they're done. We've done it.</span> <span id="sentence-72" data-timestamp="14:36" class="neutral">So I don't see this as a driver of sustained productivity growth.</span> <span id="sentence-73" data-timestamp="14:41" class="neutral">It would be a level effect. It may raise the level of productivity, but after that it's unaffected by that.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-74" data-timestamp="14:53" class="neutral">I have also heard the argument that when labor turnover was very high during the pandemic, new hires were being trained, and by the time they were ready to start contributing to production, they left for a new job and started a whole new training process.</span> <span id="sentence-75" data-timestamp="15:14" class="neutral">Now that the pace of turnover is back to kind of pre-pandemic levels, firms are reaping the benefits of their training programs as they train these workers and they stay, and now they're adding to productive output.</span> <span id="sentence-76" data-timestamp="15:32" class="neutral">But again, while I see this raising the level of productivity in the short run, it's another one of these things.</span> <span id="sentence-77" data-timestamp="15:39" class="neutral">When turnover accelerated, productivity dropped, and all you're seeing is it return to previous levels.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-78" data-timestamp="15:49" class="neutral">So I'll be watching how productivity evolves in the near term.</span> <span id="sentence-79" data-timestamp="15:54" class="neutral">I'll keep my fingers crossed for more good news, but I am not convinced that the boom in productivity growth will continue.</span> <span id="sentence-80" data-timestamp="16:04" class="neutral bold">Therefore, I will keep that in mind as I form my judgments about the economic outlook and the appropriate setting of monetary policy.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-81" data-timestamp="16:18" class="neutral">So let's talk about inflation, one of the Fed's favorite topics.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-82" data-timestamp="16:24" class="dovish">We made a lot of headway in reducing inflation in the past year.</span> <span id="sentence-83" data-timestamp="16:29" class="hawkish bold">So although the readings in the past two months clearly were disappointing, both total CPI inflation and core inflation that excludes energy and food rounded to a 0.4% increase for the month of January, which is obviously not progress toward our inflation goal.</span> <span id="sentence-84" data-timestamp="16:52" class="hawkish">While housing services prices, which rose in January, moderated a bit, core goods prices, which had been falling, recently rose due to elevated import price increases.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-85" data-timestamp="17:08" class="neutral bold">In trying to judge what the underlying trend is for inflation, I tend to look at annualized core measures over three and six-month horizons.</span> <span id="sentence-86" data-timestamp="17:19" class="dovish">For most of the year I watched those numbers come down more quickly than 12-month readings, telling me that we were making substantial progress.</span> <span id="sentence-87" data-timestamp="17:31" class="hawkish bold">But more recently, the three-month core CPI, which was running at a 3.3% rate in December, rose to 4.2% in February.</span> <span id="sentence-88" data-timestamp="17:45" class="hawkish bold">The six-month core CPI, which was also 3.3% in December, was up to 3.9% last month.</span> <span id="sentence-89" data-timestamp="17:56" class="hawkish bold">So these shorter-term inflation measures are now telling me that progress has slowed and may have stalled.</span> <span id="sentence-90" data-timestamp="18:04" class="neutral">But we'll need to see more data to know that.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-91" data-timestamp="18:11" class="neutral bold">Now the FOMC uses personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation data to measure progress toward our 2% goal, and we won't get those results for February until this Friday.</span> <span id="sentence-92" data-timestamp="18:26" class="hawkish">But as I noted at the start, based on the CPI and producer prices that we have in hand, estimates suggest that core PCE inflation is likely to be elevated over the month's readings that we got at the end of 2023, though February's reading is estimated to step down from January's.</span> <span id="sentence-93" data-timestamp="18:51" class="hawkish bold">This recent pace would not represent significant progress towards 2%.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-94" data-timestamp="19:00" class="neutral">Let me pause here and make an important point about how I think about and want to talk about adverse developments such as this recent inflation data, and how as a policy maker I manage risk to the economic outlook.</span> <span id="sentence-95" data-timestamp="19:20" class="neutral">It is appropriate to point out that a month or two of data does not necessarily indicate a trend.</span> <span id="sentence-96" data-timestamp="19:28" class="neutral">I joked to my students, "With one data point I can draw any line through it. With two I can draw a trend. With three I can run a regression."</span> <span id="sentence-97" data-timestamp="19:41" class="neutral">There are good reasons to think that progress on inflation will be uneven but likely to continue down toward 2%.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-98" data-timestamp="19:52" class="neutral">At the same time, monetary policy is data driven, and I do want to take it into account when formulating my economic outlook.</span> <span id="sentence-99" data-timestamp="20:03" class="neutral">While I don't want to overreact to two months of data, I do think it is appropriate to react to it.</span> <span id="sentence-100" data-timestamp="20:13" class="neutral">There is ample evidence that the recent data has been taken on board by both financial markets and forecasters in adjusting their views of the economic outlook.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-101" data-timestamp="20:27" class="hawkish bold">These markets have pulled back the number of expected rate cuts in 2024.</span> <span id="sentence-102" data-timestamp="20:34" class="neutral">FOMC participants have also adjusted their views on policy in response to recent data, and it is reflected in the Summary of Economic Projections, or the SEP.</span> <span id="sentence-103" data-timestamp="20:46" class="hawkish">Comparing the December 2023 projections to those just released, one sees that while the median number of cuts in the federal funds rate for 2024 is still three, the dots for 2024 have moved up, meaning at least several policy makers removed one or more cuts from their projection.</span> <span id="sentence-104" data-timestamp="21:11" class="hawkish">In fact, the number of policy makers expecting more than three cuts in 2024 decreased significantly, while the number expecting two or fewer increased.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-105" data-timestamp="21:26" class="neutral">I'm interpreting this as showing that the committee is not overreacting to the recent data - that's why the median has stayed the same - but it is not discounting the data, which is the shift up in the distribution.</span> <span id="sentence-106" data-timestamp="21:44" class="hawkish bold">So in my view, it is appropriate to reduce the overall number of rate cuts or push them further into the future in response to the recent data.</span> <span id="sentence-107" data-timestamp="21:56" class="neutral">This just reflects the reality of managing an outlook in real time as data comes in.</span> <span id="sentence-108" data-timestamp="22:03" class="neutral">Now subsequent data may well alter this outlook again, but we shall see.</span> <span id="sentence-109" data-timestamp="22:10" class="neutral">Based on what we know now, there is no urgency in taking that step.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-110" data-timestamp="22:19" class="neutral">So where do I see things standing?</span> <span id="sentence-111" data-timestamp="22:22" class="neutral">I see economic output and the labor market showing continued strength, while progress in reducing inflation has slowed.</span> <span id="sentence-112" data-timestamp="22:32" class="hawkish bold">Because of these signs, I see no rush in taking the step of beginning to ease monetary policy.</span> <span id="sentence-113" data-timestamp="22:40" class="hawkish bold">The target range for the federal funds rate has been 5.00% to 5.25% since last July, and I believe that this restrictive level is helping to reduce imbalances in the economy and continuing to put downward pressure on inflation.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-114" data-timestamp="23:01" class="neutral">All indications are that the economy continues to grow at a healthy pace.</span> <span id="sentence-115" data-timestamp="23:07" class="neutral">While retail sales and some other indicators suggest a softening in demand this quarter from the second half of last year, when growth accelerated, the evidence for a significant slowdown is sparse.</span> <span id="sentence-116" data-timestamp="23:23" class="hawkish">Meanwhile, as the labor market continues to add jobs at a rapid pace, some signs point to improvement in the imbalance between supply and demand, but others indicate continued tightness.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-117" data-timestamp="23:40" class="neutral">My judgment on the balance of risk for monetary policy, which I explained in a speech on February 22nd, hasn't changed.</span> <span id="sentence-118" data-timestamp="23:50" class="dovish bold">The risk of waiting a little longer to cut rates is significantly lower than acting too soon.</span> <span id="sentence-119" data-timestamp="23:58" class="most-hawkish bold">Cutting the policy rate too soon and risking a sustained rebound in inflation is something I definitely want to avoid.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-120" data-timestamp="24:10" class="hawkish bold">As a result, in the absence of an unexpected and material deterioration in the real economy, I'm going to need to see at least a couple of months of better inflation data before I have enough confidence that beginning to cut rates will keep the economy on a path to 2% inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-121" data-timestamp="24:32" class="dovish">Fortunately, we can wait and see how the data come in before deciding the appropriate time to start lowering the policy rate.</span> <span id="sentence-122" data-timestamp="24:42" class="neutral">The remarkable U.S. economy keeps on chugging along, adding jobs at a rate that over time will keep unemployment near its current historically low rate.</span> <span id="sentence-123" data-timestamp="24:55" class="neutral bold">But the overall strength of the U.S. economy makes it a fairly easy decision to wait a little longer to get a better understanding of the trajectory of inflation and when appropriate to begin easing policy.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-124" data-timestamp="25:12" class="neutral">So thank you.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-125" data-timestamp="25:15" class="neutral">Okay, thank you Chris, that was very clear, very nice.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-126" data-timestamp="25:24" class="neutral">You know, I found out Minnesota, my grandfather and brother were the first... very fond of Paul, so you know, I'm going to ask you exactly what day you're going to raise rates and by how much, maybe not so soon.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-127" data-timestamp="25:43" class="neutral">I'm also going to try and cover a few other topics.</span> <span id="sentence-128" data-timestamp="25:46" class="neutral">As a researcher myself, what have we learned about Fed modeling and models of inflation?</span> <span id="sentence-129" data-timestamp="25:53" class="neutral">What happened at SVB bank?</span> <span id="sentence-130" data-timestamp="25:56" class="neutral">What kinds of forward guidance should we have?</span> <span id="sentence-131" data-timestamp="25:59" class="neutral">And so on.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-132" data-timestamp="26:02" class="neutral">But I'll start with what everybody wants to know.</span> <span id="sentence-133" data-timestamp="26:06" class="neutral">We can't forget that just a little while ago, Larry Summers famously told this group, and if he didn't tell this group, he came to Yale and told us that to get inflation out of the economy, there'd have to be 7.5% unemployment for two years or 10% unemployment for one year.</span> <span id="sentence-134" data-timestamp="26:31" class="neutral">And now as you said, we're almost there.</span> <span id="sentence-135" data-timestamp="26:36" class="neutral">Alan Blinder, who's an optimist and who himself thought things were going to go well, wrote a book right in the middle of COVID during the history of the Fed in which he pointed out there's almost never any soft landings.</span> <span id="sentence-136" data-timestamp="26:52" class="neutral">And yet you've done it.</span> <span id="sentence-137" data-timestamp="26:55" class="neutral">So let me begin by saying congratulations.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-138" data-timestamp="27:00" class="neutral">Well, we're not quite there.</span> <span id="sentence-139" data-timestamp="27:02" class="neutral">Hold off.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-140" data-timestamp="27:06" class="neutral">So one of the big theoretical issues and arguments you had with Larry Summers and Olivier Blanchard was about the Beveridge curve, and you famously said that the Beveridge curve has a very convex shape.</span> <span id="sentence-141" data-timestamp="27:21" class="neutral">That when there are a lot of vacancies, if you put a brake on activity, you can reduce the vacancies without changing unemployment.</span> <span id="sentence-142" data-timestamp="27:31" class="neutral">And Larry Summers and company basically thought that was wrong, and as vacancies came down, unemployment would soar.</span> <span id="sentence-143" data-timestamp="27:40" class="neutral">Well, it seems that you were right.</span> <span id="sentence-144" data-timestamp="27:43" class="neutral">And now the question is, vacancies have come down a lot, so that curve is not so convex probably as it was before.</span> <span id="sentence-145" data-timestamp="27:52" class="neutral">So are you worried a little bit that if you keep the pressure on, unemployment will start to go up?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-146" data-timestamp="28:01" class="neutral">Yeah, so I just want to comment.</span> <span id="sentence-147" data-timestamp="28:04" class="neutral">Part of the debate back then was, you know, traditional models would have said for the Fed to slam on the brakes and drive the policy rate up 500 basis points in basically a year, that was going to throw the economy in recession, unemployment would skyrocket.</span> <span id="sentence-148" data-timestamp="28:26" class="neutral">That was traditional and a lot of historical evidence.</span> <span id="sentence-149" data-timestamp="28:31" class="neutral">So this was not a crazy argument that they were making.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-150" data-timestamp="28:36" class="neutral">What I was seeing, and this is where the value in my job is, talking to people on the street and getting anecdotal evidence from business people instead of just talking with a bunch of academics.</span> <span id="sentence-151" data-timestamp="28:51" class="neutral">The thing I kept hearing over and over at this time was, "I can't find workers. I'm losing workers as fast as I hire them."</span> <span id="sentence-152" data-timestamp="29:01" class="neutral">And it just seemed odd to me to say, if I raise interest rates and you're in this situation, the first thing you're going to do is lay off your existing employees when you can't even find the ones you want.</span> <span id="sentence-153" data-timestamp="29:15" class="neutral">It just sounded completely backwards from what I was hearing anecdotally talking to business people all around the country.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-154" data-timestamp="29:27" class="neutral">So that was part of what fed my thinking - why would you just get rid of vacancies first before you ever got rid of your existing employees?</span> <span id="sentence-155" data-timestamp="29:38" class="neutral">So that was kind of from my governor role and talking with the American public in general, that's what led me to think about this.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-156" data-timestamp="29:49" class="neutral">Now you're right, this Beveridge curve thing is very steep, and that's what we've been moving down.</span> <span id="sentence-157" data-timestamp="29:57" class="neutral">If you ever looked at the data, it does flatten out.</span> <span id="sentence-158" data-timestamp="30:01" class="neutral">And once, and I actually in this piece I wrote with Andrew Figura, we did point out that getting the vacancy rate down from 7% to 4% you wouldn't have much change in unemployment.</span> <span id="sentence-159" data-timestamp="30:17" class="neutral">But if you went from 4% to 2%, if you blew through 4.5% to 2%, unemployment would go up to something like 7%.</span> <span id="sentence-160" data-timestamp="30:30" class="neutral">So that's the point - once you get down to this flat part of the Beveridge curve, you've got to kind of be careful because you can easily tip and then go the wrong direction.</span> <span id="sentence-161" data-timestamp="30:42" class="neutral">So that's what we're trying to keep an eye on and stay cautious.</span> <span id="sentence-162" data-timestamp="30:47" class="neutral">And so far the economy has supported our cautious approach.</span> <span id="sentence-163" data-timestamp="30:52" class="neutral">You know, we'll just kind of see.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-164" data-timestamp="30:57" class="neutral">Your talk was so optimistic.</span> <span id="sentence-165" data-timestamp="31:01" class="neutral">Would you ever dream of raising rates again?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-166" data-timestamp="31:06" class="neutral">Well, something would really have to dramatically change for that.</span> <span id="sentence-167" data-timestamp="31:12" class="neutral">We never say never in central banking, but something would really have to dramatically change on the inflation front to think about that.</span> <span id="sentence-168" data-timestamp="31:24" class="neutral">And we're not seeing that, even with the last two months.</span> <span id="sentence-169" data-timestamp="31:29" class="neutral">It's not showing up in any way that's serious.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-170" data-timestamp="31:34" class="neutral">You didn't talk too much about wage growth and wage inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-171" data-timestamp="31:39" class="neutral">Is that something that seems to be higher than pretty high?</span> <span id="sentence-172" data-timestamp="31:44" class="neutral">Is that something that you pay a lot of attention to or are worried about?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-173" data-timestamp="31:50" class="neutral">Well, I mean, there's a broad set of measures of wages, compensation, and how it's measured.</span> <span id="sentence-174" data-timestamp="32:01" class="neutral">The bulk of the ones that I've seen in wages and compensation are still growing in the low 4% range.</span> <span id="sentence-175" data-timestamp="32:11" class="neutral">Which, if you thought of long-run productivity growth at 1.5%-2%, 2% inflation, you would think 3.5% is kind of what would be consistent with 2%.</span> <span id="sentence-176" data-timestamp="32:27" class="neutral">So you're at 4%-4.25%, you're above that, but you're not that far above it.</span> <span id="sentence-177" data-timestamp="32:35" class="neutral">And productivity growth has been shockingly strong for the last three months.</span> <span id="sentence-178" data-timestamp="32:40" class="neutral">So it's not like it's out of the realm of potentially being non-inflationary, given the way that productivity has grown.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-179" data-timestamp="32:52" class="neutral">Now, if productivity slows back down, wage growth will probably slow back down.</span> <span id="sentence-180" data-timestamp="32:58" class="neutral">If productivity growth stays high, there's no reason for wage growth to continue coming down.</span> <span id="sentence-181" data-timestamp="33:05" class="neutral">That's what I want - I want people's real wages to go up because they're more productive.</span> <span id="sentence-182" data-timestamp="33:11" class="neutral">That's a good sign.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-183" data-timestamp="33:14" class="neutral">I'm curious, how much, when the Fed makes this decision now about whether to reduce or not reduce, are you just sort of playing the numbers and looking at what the data are saying about inflation and unemployment?</span> <span id="sentence-184" data-timestamp="33:29" class="neutral">Or are you thinking a little more abstractly about what the real rate should be?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-185" data-timestamp="33:36" class="neutral">It seems like the short rate is still 5% and inflation maybe 3%, so that's a 2% real rate there in the short run.</span> <span id="sentence-186" data-timestamp="33:46" class="neutral">And if you look at the TIPS, it's 2% in the long run.</span> <span id="sentence-187" data-timestamp="33:51" class="neutral">That's very high compared to where things have been for the last 20 years, except for a few occasions in the 2008 crisis and just before.</span> <span id="sentence-188" data-timestamp="34:03" class="neutral">It's not anywhere near that.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-189" data-timestamp="34:07" class="neutral">So is just targeting the real rate something that you are thinking about doing?</span> <span id="sentence-190" data-timestamp="34:13" class="neutral">Or is that on the back burner and you're just playing the numbers for a while?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-191" data-timestamp="34:19" class="neutral">Well, we typically have some, if you look at the SEP, we put a long-run policy rate.</span> <span id="sentence-192" data-timestamp="34:28" class="neutral">If you take that number and subtract off 2%, that tells you what each member thinks the long-run real return should be, or the infamous r-star.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-193" data-timestamp="34:42" class="neutral">For 40 years that thing has been falling like a stone, and it stayed very low throughout the 2010 decade.</span> <span id="sentence-194" data-timestamp="34:52" class="neutral">And now there's a lot of discussion whether that has suddenly come up.</span> <span id="sentence-195" data-timestamp="34:57" class="neutral">We don't know.</span> <span id="sentence-196" data-timestamp="34:59" class="neutral">I mean, there's just general uncertainty, and you can start seeing it even on the SEP and among the committee members, that kind of the dispersion across the final policy rate has widened from say two years ago.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-197" data-timestamp="35:18" class="neutral">So some members are starting to think that it has gone up and that maybe we're not as restrictive as we think we are.</span> <span id="sentence-198" data-timestamp="35:27" class="neutral">If you think the real rate is a half a percent, if you think it's one to one-and-a-half, we're maybe not as restrictive.</span> <span id="sentence-199" data-timestamp="35:36" class="neutral">Some of my colleagues on the FOMC have been out talking about this.</span> <span id="sentence-200" data-timestamp="35:41" class="neutral">We just don't know.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-201" data-timestamp="35:44" class="neutral">My own thoughts on this have always been, it's one thing to say it's gone up because you see long-term rates go up and you see the economy maybe not as restrictive as you would think it would be.</span> <span id="sentence-202" data-timestamp="36:01" class="neutral">But I always want to know, what's the economics behind it?</span> <span id="sentence-203" data-timestamp="36:06" class="neutral">Just not "Oh, r-star went up because real rates are higher." You have to explain to me why real rates on safe, liquid government debt fell for 40 years and why suddenly it turned around.</span> <span id="sentence-204" data-timestamp="36:24" class="neutral">And no one's really given a lot of very good answers to that.</span> <span id="sentence-205" data-timestamp="36:29" class="neutral">But it's a great research question for your students to go figure out and tell me what the right answer is.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-206" data-timestamp="36:38" class="neutral">Well, I can tell you what some people have said. You've talked about this, that's why you don't need to talk that much about it here.</span> <span id="sentence-207" data-timestamp="36:46" class="neutral">But I mean, some people say maybe the dollar is not going to be so important in the global currency, that there are all kinds of alternatives.</span> <span id="sentence-208" data-timestamp="36:57" class="neutral">You know, that might affect the rate.</span> <span id="sentence-209" data-timestamp="37:01" class="neutral">Or other people, and I don't know if I believe in that one, but one that I'm quite worried about is that our debt situation has gotten so bad that maybe, you know, people are starting to worry about American debt and the rates got to be higher for that reason.</span> <span id="sentence-210" data-timestamp="37:19" class="neutral">Do you see any logic to that?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-211" data-timestamp="37:22" class="neutral">Well, in terms of the reserve currency, I gave a speech about a little over a month ago.</span> <span id="sentence-212" data-timestamp="37:30" class="neutral">It was a great speech, by the way.</span> <span id="sentence-213" data-timestamp="37:33" class="neutral">And it just was trying to point out that despite all the doom and gloom, people are saying the US dollar is still the reserve currency by a mile over any other option.</span> <span id="sentence-214" data-timestamp="37:47" class="neutral">And that even things, when people talk about "Bitcoin is going to replace it," yeah, ain't going to happen.</span> <span id="sentence-215" data-timestamp="37:57" class="neutral">Stablecoins - I tried to point out stablecoins are almost 99% denominated in US dollars.</span> <span id="sentence-216" data-timestamp="38:06" class="neutral">So all that does is expand the reach of the dollar across crypto, DeFi, other environments.</span> <span id="sentence-217" data-timestamp="38:16" class="neutral">So all this stuff actually strengthens the global role of the dollar, not weakens it.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-218" data-timestamp="38:25" class="neutral">In terms of the r-star, you know, there's a lot of discussion about the role of government debt in the world, global demand.</span> <span id="sentence-219" data-timestamp="38:36" class="neutral">So far, global demand has fallen off some, but not nearly back to even 90s levels.</span> <span id="sentence-220" data-timestamp="38:44" class="neutral">I mean, it's still pretty high.</span> <span id="sentence-221" data-timestamp="38:47" class="neutral">Issuance is potentially going to be high.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-222" data-timestamp="38:53" class="neutral">You know, we typically don't comment on fiscal policy, but it does seem hard to believe that running deficits of 7% of GDP is sustainable in any long-run sense.</span> <span id="sentence-223" data-timestamp="39:08" class="neutral">I'm not going to tell Congress how they deal with it, but I can kind of point out that it doesn't seem like you can do this forever.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-224" data-timestamp="39:19" class="neutral">Is there anything the Fed can do if, suppose it does continue and the fiscal, you know, Congress just can't change its ways?</span> <span id="sentence-225" data-timestamp="39:28" class="neutral">There's not much the Fed can do about that, I guess.</span> <span id="sentence-226" data-timestamp="39:32" class="neutral">That's Congress's job.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-227" data-timestamp="39:35" class="neutral">So I just said I'm not going to say anything about how you fix this problem.</span> <span id="sentence-228" data-timestamp="39:40" class="neutral">That's Congress's job.</span> <span id="sentence-229" data-timestamp="39:43" class="neutral">So there isn't, you know, other than just to point out that we know from just basic economics, you can't run deficits of this magnitude forever.</span> <span id="sentence-230" data-timestamp="39:55" class="neutral">It just doesn't work out.</span> <span id="sentence-231" data-timestamp="39:58" class="neutral">That path doesn't work.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-232" data-timestamp="40:02" class="neutral">You'd get a higher r-star in that case, probably, wouldn't you?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-233" data-timestamp="40:07" class="neutral">Yeah, yeah.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-234" data-timestamp="40:09" class="neutral">So you're talking about when to act and when not to act.</span> <span id="sentence-235" data-timestamp="40:14" class="neutral">I asked you sort of jokingly if you're going to raise rates.</span> <span id="sentence-236" data-timestamp="40:18" class="neutral">You said probably not.</span> <span id="sentence-237" data-timestamp="40:20" class="neutral">But you know, you're pretty sure you're going to lower rates.</span> <span id="sentence-238" data-timestamp="40:24" class="neutral">So you've got a choice - you could move pretty soon to lower them and just do it very gradually, tiny little things.</span> <span id="sentence-239" data-timestamp="40:33" class="neutral">Or you could wait until it's really clear and then move in big steps.</span> <span id="sentence-240" data-timestamp="40:39" class="neutral">How do you decide which is the best thing to do?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-241" data-timestamp="40:45" class="neutral">Yeah, I mean, this is actually a serious discussion people have about should you go early and go slow, or go later and maybe have to go faster.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-242" data-timestamp="40:58" class="neutral">When we've gone fast in the past in cutting rates, it's almost always because some shock has hit the economy.</span> <span id="sentence-243" data-timestamp="41:07" class="neutral">Probably if you pay any attention to me whatsoever in the past, you know it's usually a big shock that hits, and that's why we cut rates.</span> <span id="sentence-244" data-timestamp="41:18" class="neutral">Just take the pandemic - boom, you went from wherever you were to zero in one meeting.</span> <span id="sentence-245" data-timestamp="41:25" class="neutral">That's what happens when you get big cuts.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-246" data-timestamp="41:29" class="neutral">When the economy is doing fine, there's no reason to do really big movements.</span> <span id="sentence-247" data-timestamp="41:35" class="neutral">So you can do smaller movements.</span> <span id="sentence-248" data-timestamp="41:38" class="neutral">Then the only issue is, do I start doing the small movements now?</span> <span id="sentence-249" data-timestamp="41:44" class="neutral">Or do I wait a meeting or two meetings or three meetings and then go in smaller steps?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-250" data-timestamp="41:53" class="neutral">So I think that's the way to think about it.</span> <span id="sentence-251" data-timestamp="41:56" class="neutral">It's not that if we wait, we're going to have to go big.</span> <span id="sentence-252" data-timestamp="42:00" class="neutral">We can still go small, it's just when's the starting point.</span> <span id="sentence-253" data-timestamp="42:05" class="neutral">But right now the economy has given us no reason that we have to do big cuts in the policy rate.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-254" data-timestamp="42:15" class="neutral">Do you talk at all about who's bearing the cost of the high rates?</span> <span id="sentence-255" data-timestamp="42:20" class="neutral">Does that come up?</span> <span id="sentence-256" data-timestamp="42:22" class="neutral">I mean, you know, homeowners and some of the public are concerned that there are disadvantaged people who are particularly facing the high rates.</span> <span id="sentence-257" data-timestamp="42:33" class="neutral">Does that enter the policy discussions of the Fed?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-258" data-timestamp="42:38" class="neutral">It always has.</span> <span id="sentence-259" data-timestamp="42:40" class="neutral">I mean, this has been the nature of the Fed.</span> <span id="sentence-260" data-timestamp="42:43" class="neutral">When you move rates, there are winners and there are losers.</span> <span id="sentence-261" data-timestamp="42:47" class="neutral">It's just a fact - more interest sensitive sectors are going to bear both bigger costs and bigger benefits when interest rates move.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-262" data-timestamp="42:58" class="neutral">So it's, you know, of course it's no surprise we've raised rates a lot, mortgage rates have shot up in a way that an entire generation of buyers has never seen a mortgage rate at 7%.</span> <span id="sentence-263" data-timestamp="43:14" class="neutral">I waited 10 years to get a mortgage rate of 7% down from 13%.</span> <span id="sentence-264" data-timestamp="43:21" class="neutral">So it's just, what you know, in the last 15 plus years, we just haven't seen mortgage rates so high.</span> <span id="sentence-265" data-timestamp="43:30" class="neutral">And it's just a cultural thing, and it's a shock.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-266" data-timestamp="43:35" class="neutral">Now, if we can get everything down, if we get some rates down, mortgage rates would naturally follow.</span> <span id="sentence-267" data-timestamp="43:42" class="neutral">And then that'll take some of the burden off of people trying to buy houses.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-268" data-timestamp="43:48" class="neutral">You entered the Fed in the middle of a crisis, and you've managed to solve things pretty much.</span> <span id="sentence-269" data-timestamp="43:56" class="neutral">The Fed's done a great job by getting us close to a soft landing.</span> <span id="sentence-270" data-timestamp="44:01" class="neutral">Got a little ways to go.</span> <span id="sentence-271" data-timestamp="44:03" class="neutral">But in the middle of the crisis, things really seemed bad.</span> <span id="sentence-272" data-timestamp="44:08" class="neutral">And again, we got through it.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-273" data-timestamp="44:11" class="neutral">You weren't there in March 2020 when the whole financial system was about to collapse, but things were still pretty bad at the end of 2020 when you came on board.</span> <span id="sentence-274" data-timestamp="44:25" class="neutral">And is there, I'm just interested in this psychological question.</span> <span id="sentence-275" data-timestamp="44:30" class="neutral">Is there a difference in the room and how it feels when you're in the middle of a crisis like that?</span> <span id="sentence-276" data-timestamp="44:38" class="neutral">I mean, when Western civilization is hanging in the balance, what does it feel like to be in that situation?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-277" data-timestamp="44:48" class="neutral">Well, I just want to say that, you know, I wasn't on the Board of Governors in 2020 when the pandemic hit.</span> <span id="sentence-278" data-timestamp="44:58" class="neutral">But Jay Powell and my colleagues at the time, I thought, did a spectacular job responding the absolute best way that we could to try to stabilize the financial markets and do what we could to help the recovery.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-279" data-timestamp="45:19" class="neutral">You know, some of these things may have been contributing factors down the road to the inflation we saw a year later.</span> <span id="sentence-280" data-timestamp="45:29" class="neutral">But, you know, once we realized that this inflation wasn't going to be transitory, we quickly pivoted, raised rates 500 basis points, which hadn't been done, I don't think, ever, except for Volcker, and he just let them go, he wasn't targeting an increase.</span> <span id="sentence-281" data-timestamp="45:52" class="neutral">And then we've been able to do this without crashing the economy in any way.</span> <span id="sentence-282" data-timestamp="45:58" class="neutral">So, you know, we just do the job we're supposed to do.</span> <span id="sentence-283" data-timestamp="46:03" class="neutral">I guess that's the only answer I can give.</span> <span id="sentence-284" data-timestamp="46:06" class="neutral">I was put in to do a certain job.</span> <span id="sentence-285" data-timestamp="46:09" class="neutral">I look at the data a certain way, and these were the actions I felt we had to take.</span> <span id="sentence-286" data-timestamp="46:15" class="neutral">And fortunately, they seem to have worked out.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-287" data-timestamp="46:21" class="neutral">But, you know, I wasn't there in the actual absolute panic moment in March of 2020.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-288" data-timestamp="46:31" class="neutral">Right.</span> <span id="sentence-289" data-timestamp="46:32" class="hawkish">But somehow inflation did get to 10%, and I guess something academics are going to ask themselves for years on is, you know, what could we have done differently to prevent that from happening?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-290" data-timestamp="46:49" class="neutral">And so I want to talk a little bit about the, so you know, there's a big discussion about alluded to supply chain problems.</span> <span id="sentence-291" data-timestamp="46:58" class="neutral">Do you think we can say that supply chain problems are behind us?</span> <span id="sentence-292" data-timestamp="47:03" class="neutral">Or do you think, like Baltimore shows, we still got them?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-293" data-timestamp="47:08" class="neutral">Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.</span> <span id="sentence-294" data-timestamp="47:10" class="neutral">The pandemic had, you know, my own view is the inflation that we saw was a combination of both supply and demand factors.</span> <span id="sentence-295" data-timestamp="47:22" class="neutral">It wasn't one or the other.</span> <span id="sentence-296" data-timestamp="47:25" class="neutral">And we've seen supply factors unwind.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-297" data-timestamp="47:30" class="neutral">Typical, again, with my real market outreach, talking to American businesses, how are things?</span> <span id="sentence-298" data-timestamp="47:38" class="neutral">Most of them don't talk much about supply problems anymore.</span> <span id="sentence-299" data-timestamp="47:43" class="neutral">There's always the odd off-the-cuff kind of one part isn't coming through.</span> <span id="sentence-300" data-timestamp="47:49" class="neutral">But for the most part, they're getting what they need to produce what they want.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-301" data-timestamp="47:56" class="neutral">Some sectors, some isolated things, but across the economy, the general sense I give from talking to people in the business world is, yeah, supply problems are really not a big deal anymore.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-302" data-timestamp="48:13" class="neutral">So, well, that tailwind is what I kind of mentioned.</span> <span id="sentence-303" data-timestamp="48:18" class="neutral">That tailwind we may have gotten in 2023 may well be gone.</span> <span id="sentence-304" data-timestamp="48:24" class="neutral">So from here on out, we've got to rely more on us potentially to get inflation back down.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-305" data-timestamp="48:32" class="neutral">As for Baltimore, I just want to say, I mean, it's a horrific thing to watch.</span> <span id="sentence-306" data-timestamp="48:38" class="neutral">I mean, to see it on video and to see it and know what happened, you know, your hearts go out to all the families that were affected by it.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-307" data-timestamp="48:49" class="neutral">But in terms of the economic impact of it, it's Baltimore processes 2-3% of cargo in the U.S.</span> <span id="sentence-308" data-timestamp="48:59" class="neutral">So it's small.</span> <span id="sentence-309" data-timestamp="49:01" class="neutral">A lot of this can be diverted.</span> <span id="sentence-310" data-timestamp="49:04" class="neutral">And it's very specialized type of cargo from what I understand, and a lot of this can be diverted to other East Coast ports, which have actually been running under capacity for the last two years.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-311" data-timestamp="49:20" class="neutral">So as far as we can sort out at the Board, this isn't likely to have any big major impact on either the real side of the economy or inflation overall.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-312" data-timestamp="49:35" class="neutral">Got one or two model questions. I'll be quick.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-313" data-timestamp="49:40" class="neutral">You know, one interesting thing, very interesting to me, and I know you've thought about this, is that if you look at credit spreads or general index of financial conditions, it's improved a lot.</span> <span id="sentence-314" data-timestamp="49:54" class="neutral">I mean, it's the economy, it's much better.</span> <span id="sentence-315" data-timestamp="49:58" class="neutral">And that's partly because of the Fed, you know, rescuing us from the near catastrophe.</span> <span id="sentence-316" data-timestamp="50:05" class="neutral">But that works almost against you when you're trying to tighten the economy and all these other conditions are getting looser.</span> <span id="sentence-317" data-timestamp="50:12" class="neutral">Makes it much harder, doesn't it?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-318" data-timestamp="50:15" class="neutral">Yeah.</span> <span id="sentence-319" data-timestamp="50:16" class="neutral">So by a lot of financial conditions indexes, which kind of add a whole bunch of different financial conditions, they've tended to soften since December.</span> <span id="sentence-320" data-timestamp="50:28" class="neutral">But a lot of that is the stock market, and a lot of that is driven by seven firms and maybe two firms, all driven by AI, which is not something about financial looseness of conditions.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-321" data-timestamp="50:45" class="neutral">And so I've tended to prefer to take some of the stock market stuff out, particularly recently.</span> <span id="sentence-322" data-timestamp="50:52" class="neutral">And when you look at the last few months, just look at real rates on the two-year and the ten-year treasury.</span> <span id="sentence-323" data-timestamp="51:00" class="hawkish">Back in December, the ten-year was around 360 basis points.</span> <span id="sentence-324" data-timestamp="51:06" class="hawkish">Now it's like 420.</span> <span id="sentence-325" data-timestamp="51:09" class="hawkish">So it's up 60 basis points.</span> <span id="sentence-326" data-timestamp="51:12" class="hawkish">Two-year is up about the same.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-327" data-timestamp="51:15" class="neutral">So in terms of real interest rates, for the most part, real rates have gone back up since Christmas.</span> <span id="sentence-328" data-timestamp="51:23" class="neutral">And that's the tension that I look at, the interest rates.</span> <span id="sentence-329" data-timestamp="51:27" class="neutral">That's the best I can control.</span> <span id="sentence-330" data-timestamp="51:29" class="neutral">I can't control the stock market in any serious way.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-331" data-timestamp="51:34" class="neutral">But their credit spreads above the real interest rate, and those things have gotten smaller.</span> <span id="sentence-332" data-timestamp="51:41" class="neutral">And most of the borrowing is by people who are risky borrowers, not riskless borrowers.</span> <span id="sentence-333" data-timestamp="51:48" class="neutral">And so I'm wondering, since that drives the economy, the risky borrowers, do you think in the future, or maybe even now, the Fed is paying close attention to its effect on spreads and how its interest rate moves might affect spreads and thereby affect the economy?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-334" data-timestamp="52:07" class="neutral">Spreads always come into play.</span> <span id="sentence-335" data-timestamp="52:10" class="neutral">Usually the classic thing is the tighter they get, the looser the policy.</span> <span id="sentence-336" data-timestamp="52:15" class="neutral">The wider they get, the tighter the policy.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-337" data-timestamp="52:19" class="neutral">There's lots of factors that go into determining spreads.</span> <span id="sentence-338" data-timestamp="52:23" class="neutral">For example, just the economy is doing really well despite how high we have rates.</span> <span id="sentence-339" data-timestamp="52:29" class="neutral">And that's going to tend to push down spreads all by itself, independent of what we do.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-340" data-timestamp="52:36" class="neutral">You have a lot of money coming in in private credit.</span> <span id="sentence-341" data-
