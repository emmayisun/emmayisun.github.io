title: Fed's Waller Sees No Rush to Cut Rates Despite Progress on Inflation
categories: Fedspeak
tags: [policy, QT, Waller]
article_excerpt: "In a recent speech, Fed Governor Christopher Waller expressed uncertainty about the pace of continued progress on inflation, citing recent hot inflation data. He stated, 'until that progress materializes, I am not ready to take that step' to cut rates, and 'in the absence of an unexpected and material deterioration in the real economy, I'm going to need to see at least a couple of months of better inflation data before I have enough confidence that beginning to cut rates will keep the economy on a path to 2% inflation.' Waller noted that the strong labor market means 'the risk of waiting a little longer to ease policy is small,' and emphasized 'no urgency in taking the step of beginning to ease monetary policy.' He sees the economy continuing to grow at a healthy pace while the labor market remains tight."

<p><span id="sentence-6" data-timestamp="03:52" class="neutral"> all right thank you Barbara and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today my subject as it often is is is the outlook for the US economy and</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-7" data-timestamp="04:02" class="neutral bold">how that affects the Federal Open Market committees or fomc's continuing effort to reduce inflation to a sustained level of 2% while maintaining a healthy labor market we made a lot of Headway toward our inflation goal in 2023 and the labor market moves substantially into better balance all while holding the unemployment rate below 4% for nearly two years but the data we have received so far this year has made me uncertain about the speed of our continued progress back in February I noted that data on fourth quarter gross domestic</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-8" data-timestamp="04:41" class="hawkish bold">product or GDP as well as January data on job growth and inflation came in hotter than expected I concluded then that we needed time to verify that the progress on inflation we saw in the second half of 2023 would continue which there was no rush to begin cutting interest rates to normalize The Stance of monetary policy over the past month additional economic data has reinforced this view February job gains moved back up to 275,000 making the three-month average a strong 265,000 a month and various inflation measures have continued to</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-9" data-timestamp="05:26" class="most-hawkish bold">come in hot core personal conern consumption expenditures or pce inflation jumped to 0.4% on a monthly basis in January after averaging around 0.1% in October through December of last year and with February Consumer Price Index or CPI and producer price index inflation data already in hand some forecast are predicting core PC inflation may be revised up from 0.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-10" data-timestamp="05:59" class="most-hawkish bold">4 in January and ex is expected to come in at 0.3% for February which we'll learn about on Friday now adding this new data to what we saw earlier in the year reinforces my view that there is no rush to cut the policy rate indeed it tells me that it is prudent to hold this rate at its current restrictive stance perhaps for longer than PR previously thought to keep inflation on a sustainable trajectory toward 2% I continue to believe that further progress will make it appropriate for the fomc to begin reducing the target</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-11" data-timestamp="06:41" class="hawkish bold">range for the federal funds rate this year but until that progress materializes I am not ready to take that step fortunately the strength of the US economy and resilience of the labor market mean the risk of waiting a little longer to ease policy is small and significantly lower than acting too soon and possibly squandering our progress on inflation now turning to the performance of the US economy the Atlanta feds GDP now model based on all current data predicts first quarter growth in Real GDP of 2.1% at an annual</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-12" data-timestamp="07:22" class="neutral">rate similarly the consensus from the Blue Chip survey of private sector forecasters is 2% now this would be a significant slowdown from the average of around 4% in the second half of 2024 but still quite solid growth consumer spending the largest component of GDP seems to be moderating this quarter retail sales fell significantly in January and then retraced about half of that decline in February smoothing out these swings they clearly indicate a moderation in good spending from the second half of last year however Services spending excluding</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-13" data-timestamp="08:09" class="neutral">new uh energy grew moderately in January which offset to some extent the decline in good spending I'll be watching on Friday morning to see what the February data on personal income and spending show now on the business side surveys of purchasing managers in February continue to report results we've been hearing for over a year for manufacturers The Institute for Supply management indicated a slight contraction in activity with new orders and production moving down a bit this contrasts with non-man manufacturing</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-14" data-timestamp="08:48" class="neutral">businesses that continue to see expansion in activity with measures of new orders and business activity on the higher end of their readings over the past last year now let me turn to the labor market the data is sending a mixed message on how supply and demand are evolving as I noted earlier payroll data estimate that employers added 275,000 jobs in J in February this Ro robust gain is not only above the 265,000 average level of creation since November but also is above the 250 51,000 monthly average for all of</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-15" data-timestamp="09:34" class="hawkish bold">2023 now recent gains have been broad-based across sectors rather than concentrated in just a few sectors which may be a sign that demand is not moderating as much as needed to support continued progress in inflation now conversely the household survey estimated that the unemployment rate Rose to 3.9% in February but that increase was driven mostly by an outsize rise in the number of 16 to 24 year olds counted as unemployed youth employment tends to be quite volatile so this rate may drop back in the next few months and if so</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-16" data-timestamp="10:16" class="neutral">pull the overall unemployment rate back down as well now a sign of loosening the labor market is that the number of people quitting their jobs has fallen below the levels just before before the pandemic I believe most workers quit their jobs for better F pay or benefits doesn't make a lot of sense to quit your job take a worse job so less turnover means firms do not need to enhance their compensation packages to attract workers and this is consistent with anecdotal evidence we're hearing in reviewing wage pressures the</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-17" data-timestamp="10:51" class="hawkish bold">most recent data suggests nominal wage growth has continued to ease but most of these measures are still above their prepandemic levels and considering overall compensation which is wages and benefits here too growth has slowed but remains elevated looking across various indicators of Labor demand there hasn't been much change in recent months job openings drifted down all through last year but then have flattened out recently at a still elevated level while the pace of hiring is close to its pre-pandemic</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-18" data-timestamp="11:28" class="hawkish bold">level with strong labor Supply and little apparent change in demand in recent months the ratio of vacancies to people looking for work has been roughly flat after declining significantly in 2023 at 1.4 jobs for each person looking that ratio is down from 2022 is peak of around two and indicates that the labor market has loosened up over the last two years but the vacancies to unemploy employed number of unemployed is still higher than the 1.2% or excuse me higher than 1.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-19" data-timestamp="12:07" class="hawkish bold">2 that prevailed before the pandemic and has held steady around 1.4 for several months this suggests that the labor market Still Remains tight now let me turn to a topic related to the labor market that has important implications for the longer term course of us e of the US economy productivity when productivity across the economy grows quickly it means that output and income can also grow quickly without putting upward pressure on inflation so it supports Rising living standards and lately productivity has been growing fast over the final three</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-20" data-timestamp="12:51" class="neutral">quarters of 2023 it grew at a pace a bit under 4% much faster than the average growth rate of productivity since the 1970s now some have argued that this must be why we had such strong economic growth in 2023 even while inflation was slowing perhaps they say we are at the start of another era of fast and sustained productivity growth such as the United States experienc from 1998 through 2004 now believe me I hope this is all true because it would be the basis for broadly shared Prosperity that raises living standards but I am skeptical that</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-21" data-timestamp="13:34" class="neutral">it will last the first thing to note is that productivity growth is notoriously volatile though productivity grew fast for the final nine months of last year it actually fell in the first quarter of 2023 and rather substantially for all of 20122 so one may view this recent fast growth as simply making up for earlier declines in fact smoothing across the past two years productivity growth averages a bit above 1.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-22" data-timestamp="14:14" class="neutral">25% annually so the level was going up it dropped down it's come back up and that fast growth is kind of what we're seeing also keep in mind that periods of fast growth that lasts more than a few years are unusual and it is also difficult to be sure what are the causes so when thinking about productivity one has to distinguish between factors that raise productivity in the short run but ultimately are oneoff increases in the level of productivity as opposed to those things that increase the long run growth rate of productivity so that the level of</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-23" data-timestamp="14:50" class="neutral">productivity is constantly Rising so let me pause at several factors that have been suggested for explaining the recent increase in prod productivity and try to place them in the oneoff or the long run buckets now many people point to recent large investment projects in the United States such as those associated with the inflation reduction act or artificial intelligence as boosting productivity but these investments will take place over many years and may not have done much yet to add to the nation's productive capacity I mean most</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-24" data-timestamp="15:28" class="neutral">firms I talk to about AI they say we're playing around with it we're exploring we're trying to see how we could use it it's not showing up in their current output and productivity so it is possible that that these things could increase longer run productivity growth it remains to be seen if they will this they are unlikely to explain the recent rise in productivity growth the recent surge in business startups after a sustained lull has also been mentioned as a factor like the investment projects it may be causing a</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-25" data-timestamp="16:01" class="neutral">boost to productivity but it's likely to occur over a number of years and unless the current boom in new business formation continues into the future once again this Factor will at best raise the level of productivity over the short term and not the long run growth rate now another factor that is often pointed to is the resolution of supply chain problems but once the the supply chain issues are resolved this boost to productivity growth will end so this is clearly a short-run factor that will simply raise the level of productivity</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-26" data-timestamp="16:39" class="neutral">but not the long run growth rate if Supply chains lowered it resolving them just brings it back up but it doesn't cause long run productivity growth another potential cause of recent productivity growth is that the pandemic changed how we work and we use techn Tech ology I've heard this many many times well I certainly can see how this would affect the level of productivity and short run growth once we have made those adjustments in the way that we work they're done we've done it so I don't see this as a driver of</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-27" data-timestamp="17:17" class="neutral">sustained productivity growth so it would be a level effect you RK raise the level of productivity but after that it's unaffected by that I have also heard the argument that when labor tuner turnover was very high during the pandemic new hires were being trained and by the time they were ready to start contributing to production they left for a new job and started a whole new training process now that the pace of turnover is back to kind of pre-pandemic levels firms are reaping the benefits of their training programs as they train</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-28" data-timestamp="17:52" class="neutral">these workers they stay and now they're adding to productive output but again while this I see this raising the level of productivity in the short run it's another one of these things that when turn accelerated productivity dropped and all you're seeing is it returned to previous levels so I'll be watching how productivity evolves in the near term I'll keep my fingers crossed for more good news but I am not convinced that the Boom in productivity growth will continue therefore I will keep that in</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-29" data-timestamp="18:27" class="hawkish bold">mind as I form my Jud judgements about the economic Outlook and the appropriate setting of monetary policy so let's talk about inflation one of the fed's favorite topics so we made a lot of Headway in reducing inflation in the past year so although the readings in the past two months clearly were disappointing both Total CPI inflation and core inflation that excludes energy and food rounded to a 4 point 0.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-30" data-timestamp="19:00" class="most-hawkish bold">4% increase for the month of February I should say January which is obviously not progress toward our inflation goal while Housing Services prices which rose in January moderated a bit core Goods prices which had been falling recently Rose due to elevated import price increases and trying to judge what the underlying trend is for inflation I tend to look at annualized core measures over three and six-month Horizons for most of the year I watch those numbers come down more quickly than 12-month readings telling me that we were making substantial progress but</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-31" data-timestamp="19:40" class="most-hawkish bold">more recently the three-month core CPI which which was running at a 3.3% rate in December Rose to 4.2 in February six-month core CPI which was also 3.3% in December was up to 3.9% last month so these shorter term inflation measures are now telling me that progress has slowed and may have stalled but we'll need to see more data to know that now the fomc uses personal consumption expenditure PC inflation data to measure progress toward our 2% goal and we won't get those results for February until this Friday but as I noted at the start based</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-32" data-timestamp="20:27" class="most-hawkish bold">on the cons CPI and producer prices that we have in hand estimates suggest that core PC inflation is likely to be elevated over the months readings that we got at the end of 2023 though February's reading is estimated to step down from januaries this recent Pace would not represent significant progress towards 2% let me pause here and take make an important point about how I think about and want to talk talk about adverse developments such as this recent inflation data and how as a policy maker I manage risk to the economic</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-33" data-timestamp="21:08" class="neutral">Outlook it is appropriate to point out that a month or two of data does not necessarily indicate a trend I just joke to my students with one data point I can draw any line through it with two I can draw a trend with three I can run a regression there are good reasons to think that progress on inflation will be uneven but likely to continue down toward 2% at the same time monetary policy is data driven and I do want to take it into account when formulating my economic Outlook while I don't want to overreact to two months of data I do</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-34" data-timestamp="21:51" class="neutral">think it is appropriate to react to it there is ample evidence that the recent data has been taken on board by both financial markets and forecasters in adjusting their views of the economic Outlook these markets have pulled back the number of expected rate Cuts in 2024 fomc participants have also adjusted their views on policy in response to recent data and it is reflected in the summary of economic projections or the SCP comparing the December 2023 proje CS to those just released one sees that while the that the medium number of cuts</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-35" data-timestamp="22:34" class="neutral">in the federal funds rate for 2024 is still three but the dots for 2024 have moved up meaning at least several policy makers removed one or more cuts from their projection in fact the number of policy M makers expecting more than three Cuts in 2024 decreased significantly while the number expecting two or fewer in increased so I interpreting this as showing that the committee is not overreacting the recent data that's why the median has stayed the same but it is not discounting the data which is the shift up in the</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-36" data-timestamp="23:17" class="neutral bold">distribution so in my view it is appropriate to reduce the overall number of rate Cuts or push them further into the future in response to the recent data this just reflects the reality of managing an Outlook in real time as data comes in now subsequent data May well alter this Outlook again but we shall see based on what we know now there is no urgency in taking that step so where do I see things standing I see economic output and the labor market showing continued strength while progress in reducing inflation has</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-37" data-timestamp="23:57" class="hawkish bold">slowed because because of these signs I see no rush in taking the step of beginning to ease monetary policy the target range for the federal fronts rate has been 5 and a qu to 5 a half% since last July and I believe that this restrictive level is helping to reduce imbalances in the economy and continuing to put downward pressure on inflation all indications are that the economy continues to grow at a healthy Pace while retail sales and some other indicators suggest a softening in demand this quarter from the second half of</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-38" data-timestamp="24:34" class="neutral">last year when growth accelerated the evidence for a significant slowdown is sparse meanwhile as the labor market continues to add jobs at a rapid Pace some signs point to Improvement in the imbalance between supply and demand but others indicate continued tightness my judgment on the balance of risk for monitoring policy which I explained in a speech on February 22nd hasn't changed the risk of waiting a little longer to cut rates is significantly lower than acting too soon cutting the policy rate too soon</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-39" data-timestamp="25:12" class="most-hawkish bold">and risking a sustained Rebound in inflation is something I definitely want to avoid as a result in the absence of an unexpected and material deterioration in the real economy I'm going to need to see at least a couple of months of better inflation Data before I have enough confidence that beginning to cut rates will keep the economy on a path to 2% inflation fortunately we can wait and see how the data come in before deciding the appropriate time to start lowering the policy rate the remarkable US economy keeps on chugging along adding</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-40" data-timestamp="25:51" class="neutral">jobs at a rate that over time will keep unemployment near its current historically low rate but the overall strength of the US economy makes it a fairly easy decision to wait a little longer to get a better understanding of the trajectory of inflation and when appropriate to begin easing policy so thank you okay thank you Chris that very clear very nice thought and You Know It uh well let me just uh say that I'm very excited of the prospect of learning a researcher a professor a decision maker inv midw a sense of humor I I found</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-41" data-timestamp="26:41" class="neutral">out Minnesota my grandfather 1992 brother were the first GRE very fondapol so you know I'm going to ask you exactly what day you're going to raise rates and by out somay maybe not soon I'm also going to try and cover a few other topics uh as a researcher myself like what have we learned about fed modeling and models of inflation and you know what happened at svv bank what kinds of forward guidance should be have and so on so I but I'll start with what everybody wants to know uh so you we we can't forget that just a</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-42" data-timestamp="27:33" class="neutral">little while ago Larry Summers famously told this group and if he didn't tell this group he came to Yale and told us that to get ring inflation out of the economy there'd have to be seven and a half un perc unemployment for two years or 10% unemployment for one year and now as you said we're almost there Alan Blinder uh who's a Optimist and who himself thought things were going to go well he wrote a book right in the middle of covid during the history of the FED in which he pointed out there almost</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-43" data-timestamp="28:07" class="neutral">never any soft Lings Landings and yet you've done it so let me Begin by saying congratulations well we're not quite there hold off so one of the big theoretical issues and arguments you had with Larry Summers and Olivia Blanchard was about the beverage curve curve and you famously said that the beverage curve has a very convex shape that when there are a lot of vacancies if you put a break on on activity you can reduce the vacancies without changing on employment and Larry Summers company basically thought that</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-44" data-timestamp="28:47" class="neutral">was wrong and as vacancies came you know as the break got put on unemployment would soar well it seems that you were right and now question is vacancies have come down a lot so that curve is not so convex probably as it was before so are you worried a little bit that if you keep the pressure on that uh unemployment will start to go up</p>

<p><span id="sentence-45" data-timestamp="29:28" class="neutral">yeah so I just Comen part of the debate back then was you know traditional models would have said for the FED to slam on the brakes and drive the policy rate at 500 basis points in basically a year that was going to throw the economy in recession unemployment Skyrock that was traditional in a lot of historical evidence so this was not a crazy argument that they were making what I was seeing and this is where the value in my job is talking to people on the street and getting anecdotal evidence from business people instead of just talking with a bunch of academics and and the thing I kept hearing over and over at this time was I can't find work workers I'm losing workers as fast as I hire them and it</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-46" data-timestamp="30:02" class="neutral">just seemed odd to me to say if I raise interest rates and you're in this situation the first thing you're going to do is lay off your existing employees when you can't even find the ones you want it just sounded completely backwards from what I was hearing anecdotally talking to business people all around the country so that's that was part of what fed my thinking is why would you just get rid of vacancies first before you ever got rid of your existing employees so that was that was kind of from my Governor role and had and</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-47" data-timestamp="30:35" class="neutral">talking with the American public in general that's that was what led me to think about this now you're right the thing is this beverage curve thing is very Steep and that's what we've been moving down if you ever looked at the data but it does flatten out and once and I actually in this piece I wrote with Andrew fera we did point out that getting the um vacancy rate down from 72% to 42% you wouldn't have much change in unemployment but if you went from 42 to two if you blew through four and a</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-48" data-timestamp="31:08" class="neutral">half to two unemployment would go up to something like 7% so that's that's the point is once you get down to this flat part of the beverage curve you got to kind of be careful because you can easily tip and then go the wrong direction so that's we're trying to keep an eye on that and stay cautious and so far the economy is supported our cautious approach um and so you know we'll just kind of see</p>

<p><span id="sentence-49" data-timestamp="31:42" class="hawkish bold">I way your talk was so optimistic uh would you ever dream of raising rates again well something would really have to dramatically change for to We Never Say Never in central bank but something would really have to dramatically change on the inflation fund to think about that and we're not seeing that even with the last two months it's not showing up anyway that serious</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-50" data-timestamp="32:15" class="neutral">so you didn't talk too much about wage growth and wage inflation is that something that that seems to be higher than pretty high is that something that you pay a lot of attention to or worried or well I mean most there's a broad set of measures of inflation or excuse me wage compensation and growth and how it's measured the bulk of the ones that I've seen in compensated wages and compensation still growing in the low 4% range which if you thought of long run productivity growth at 1 and a half% 2% inflation you would think 3 and a half% is kind of what would be consistent with 2% so you're four four and a quarter you're above that but you're not that far above it and productivity growth has been shockingly strong for the last three months so it's it's not like it's out of the realm of inflationary given the way that productivity is growth now if and we fully expect that to you know if it productivity slows back down wage growth to probably slow back down if productivity growth stays High there's no reason for wage growth to continue come that's what I want I want people's real wages to go up because they're more productive that's a good sign so</p>

<p><span id="sentence-51" data-timestamp="33:23" class="neutral">um I'm curious what how much when the FED makes this decision now about whether to reduce or not reduce are you just sort of playing the numbers and looking at what you know the data are saying about inflation and unemployment or are you think thinking a little more abstractly about you know what the the real rate should be so it seems like you know the rates your short rate is still 5% and the inflation maybe 3% so that's a 2% real rate there in the short run and the if you look at the you know tips it's 2% in the long run that's very high compared to where where things have been for you know the last 20 years except for a few occasions and the crisis of</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-52" data-timestamp="33:58" class="neutral">2008 and just before it's not anywhere near that so um just targeting the real rate is that something that you are thinking about doing or that that's in the back burner you're just playing the numbers for a while well we typically have some if you look at the SCP we put a long run policy rate which you take that number subtract off 2% that's tells you what each member thinks the long run real return should be or R star the infamous R star uh for 40 years that thing has been falling like a stone and it stayed very</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-53" data-timestamp="34:37" class="neutral">low throughout the 2010 decade and now there's a lot of discussion whether that has suddenly come up we don't know I mean there's just general uncertainty and you can start seeing it even on the SCP and among the committee members that kind of the dispersion across the final policy rate has widened from say two years ago so some members are starting to think that it has gone up and that or possibly we're not as restrictive as we think we are if you think the real rate is a half a percent if you think it's one to one and a half we're maybe not as restrictive some of my colleagues on the f1c have been out talking about this we just don't know uh my own thoughts on this has always been it's one thing to say it's gone up because you see long-term rates go up and you see the economy maybe not as restrictive as you would think think it would be but I always want to know what's the economics behind it just not oh our star went up because real rates rates are higher you have to explain to me why real rates on safe</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-54" data-timestamp="35:40" class="neutral">liquid government debt fell for 40 years and why suddenly it turned around and no one's really given a lot of very good answers that but it's a great research question for your students to go figure out and tell me what the right answer is</p>

<p><span id="sentence-55" data-timestamp="36:09" class="neutral">well I can tell you what some people have said you've talked about this that's why you don't need to talk that much about it here but I mean some people say maybe the dollar is not going to be so important in the you know the Global Currency that there are all kinds of Alternatives and you know that might affect the the rate the rate or um other people and I don't know if I believe in that one but one that I'm quite worried about is that our debt situation has gotten so bad that maybe you know people starting to worry about American debt and the rates got to be higher for that reason do you see any logic to that</p>

<p><span id="sentence-56" data-timestamp="36:44" class="neutral">well in terms of the reserve currency I gave a speech about a little over a month ago it was a great speech by the way and it just was trying to point out that despite all the Doom and Gloom people are going the US dollar is still The Preserve currency by a mile over any other option and that even things when people talk about Bitcoin is going to replace yeah ain't going to happen stable coins I tried to point out stable coins are almost 99% are denominated US dollars so all that does is expand the reach of the dollar across crypto defi other environments so all this stuff actually strengthens the global role of the dollar not weakens it in terms of the rstar you know there's there is a lot of discussion about the</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-57" data-timestamp="37:25" class="neutral bold">role of government debt in the world global demand uh so far Global demand has fallen off some but not nearly back to even 90s levels I mean it's still pretty high issuance is potentially going to be High um you know we typically don't comment on fiscal policy but it does seem hard to believe that running deficits of 7% of GDP is sustainable in any long run sense I'm not going to tell Congress how they deal with it but I can kind of point out that it doesn't seem like you can do this forever</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-58" data-timestamp="38:01" class="neutral">is there anything the FED can do if suppose it does continue and the fiscal you know the fiscal Congress just can't change its ways there's not much the FED can do about that I guess congress's job that's so I just said I'm not gonna say anything how you fix this problem that's congress's job so there isn't you know other than just to point out that we know from just basic economics you can't run deficits of this magnitude for forever it just doesn't work out path doesn't work you'd get a higher R star in that case probably</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-59" data-timestamp="38:31" class="neutral">would yeah yeah so you're talking about when to act and when not to act you know I asked you sort of jokingly are you gto raise rates you said probably not but you know you're pretty sure you're going to lower rates so you've got a choice you could you know you could move pretty soon to lower them and just do it very gradually tiny little things or you could wait until it's really clear and then move move in the big steps I mean how do you how do you decide which is the best thing to do</p>

<p><span id="sentence-60" data-timestamp="39:03" class="neutral">yeah I mean this is actually a serious discussion people have about should you go early and go slow or go later and maybe have to go faster when we've gone fast in the past and cutting rates it's almost always because some Shock has hit the economy probably if you pay any attention to me whatsoever in the past you know it's usually a big shock that hits and that's why we cut rates just take the pandemic you know boom you went from wherever you were to zero in one meeting that's what happens when you get big cuts when the</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-61" data-timestamp="39:33" class="neutral">economy is doing fine there's no reason to do really big movements so you can do smaller movements then the only issue is do I start doing the small movements now or do I wait a meeting or two meetings or three meetings and then go in smaller steps so I think that's the way to think about it it's like it's not that if we wait we're going to have to go big we can still go small it's just when's the starting point but right now the economy has given us no reason that we have to do big big cuts in the policy R</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-62" data-timestamp="40:04" class="neutral">do you talk it all about who's bearing the cost of the high rates does that come up I mean you know homeowners and uh you know there there a lot of some of the public is concerned that there's the disadvantaged people who are particularly facing the high rates does that enter the policy discussions of the fed well they always has I mean this has been the nature of the Fed when you move rates there are winners and there are losers it's just the fact of more interest sensitive sectors are going to Bear both bigger cost and bigger</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-63" data-timestamp="40:37" class="neutral">benefits when their interest rates move so it's you know of course it's no surprise we've raised rates a lot mortgage rates have shot up in a way that an entire generation of buyers has never seen a mortgage rate at 7% I waited 10 years to get a mortgage rate of 7% down from 133 so it's just what you know they just there you know like in the last 15 plus years we just haven't seen mortgage rates so high and it's just a cultural thing and it's a shock now if we can get everything down and we get some rates down mortgage rates would naturally follow and then that'll take some of the burden off of people trying to buy houses</p>

<p><span id="sentence-64" data-timestamp="41:11" class="neutral">well you you entered the FED in the middle of a crisis and uh you you've managed to solve things pretty much the fed's done a great job by uh you know getting us close to a soft Landing got a little ways to go but in the middle of the crisis things really seemed bad and again we got we got through it and uh you know I don't know how to how to you weren't there in the March 2020 when the whole financial system was about to collapse but things were still pretty bad at the end of 2020 when you came on board and is there I just this psychological question so I think some people I'm interested in is there do do do is there a difference in the the room and how it feels like when you're in the middle of a crisis like that I mean when Western Civilization is hanging in the balance what does it feel like to be in that situation</p>

<p><span id="sentence-65" data-timestamp="42:19" class="neutral">well I just want to say that you know I wasn't on the Board of Governors in 2020 when the pandemic hit but J Paul and my colleagues at the time I thought did a spectacular job responding the absolute best way that we could to try to stabilize the financial markets and do what we could to help the recovery um you know some of these things may have been contributing factors down the road to the inflation we saw a year later uh but you know once we realized that this inflation wasn't going to be transitory we quickly pivoted rais rates 500 basis points which hadn't been done don't think ever except for buker and he just let him go he wasn't targeting an increase and then we've been able to do this without you know crashing the economy anyway so you know we just do the job we're supposed to do I guess that's the only answer I can give I was put in to do a certain job I look at the data a certain way and these were the actions I felt we had to take and fortunately they seem to have worked out but</p>

<p><span id="sentence-66" data-timestamp="43:24" class="neutral">um you know I wasn't there in the actual absolute Panic moment in March of 2020 right</p>

<p><span id="sentence-67" data-timestamp="43:55" class="neutral bold">but somehow rates did I mean inflation did get to 10% % and I guess something academics are going to ask themselves from years on is you know what could we have done differently to prevent that from happening and so I want to talk a little bit about the uh so you know there's a big discussion about alluded to supply chain problems do you think we can say that supply chain problems are behind us or do you think Baltimore shows we still got them</p>

<p><span id="sentence-68" data-timestamp="44:26" class="neutral">yeah I mean that's the thing the pandemic had you know you know my own view is the inflation that we saw was a combination are both supply and demand factors it wasn't one or the other and we've seen Supply factors unwind typic again with my re my my market Outreach talking to American businesses like Howard things most of them don't talk much about Supply problems anymore there's always the odd off the cuff kind of one part isn't coming through but for the most part they're getting what they need to produce what they want some sectors some isolated things but across the economy</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-69" data-timestamp="44:56" class="neutral">the general sense I give from talking to people in the in the business world is yeah Supply problems are really not a big deal anymore so well that that Tailwind is what I kind of mentioned that Tailwind we may have gotten in 2023 May well be gone so from here on out we've got to rely more on us potentially to get inflation back to home as for Baltimore I just want to say I mean we're a horrific thing to watch I mean to see it on video and to see it and know what happened you know your hearts go out to all the families that were</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-70" data-timestamp="45:33" class="neutral">affected by but in terms of the economic impact of it it's Baltimore processes 2 to 3% of cargo in the US so it's small a lot of this can be diverted and it's very specialized type of cargo from what I understand and a lot of this can be converted to other east coast East Coast ports which have actually been running underc capacity for the last two years so as far as we can sort out at the at the board this isn't likely to have any big Major Impact on either the real side of the economy or or inflation overall</p>

<p><span id="sentence-71" data-timestamp="46:08" class="neutral">got don't one or two model questions I'll be quick um I can see our chair woman wants us to move on Q so you know one interesting thing very interesting to me and I know you've thought about this is that uh if you look at credit spreads or general index of financial conditions it's improved a lot I mean it's the economy it it's much better and that's partly because of the fed you know rescuing us from the near catastrophe but that works almost against you when you're trying to tighten the economy and all these other conditions are getting looser makes it much harder doesn't it</p>

<p><span id="sentence-72" data-timestamp="46:44" class="neutral">yeah so by by a lot of financial conditions index which kind of add a whole bunch of different Financial conditions they've tended to soften since December but a lot of that is stock is the stock market and a lot of that is driven by seven firms and maybe two firms all driven by AI which is not something about financial looseness of conditions and so I've tended to prefer to take some of the stock market stuff out particularly recently and when you look at the last few months just look at real rates on the two-year and the 10year treasury back in December the tenure was around 360 basis points now it's like 420 so it's up 60 basis points two years up about the same so in terms of real interest rates for the most part real rates have gone back up since Christmas and that's the tension that I look at the interest rates that's the best I can control I can't control the stock Mark any serious way</p>

<p><span id="sentence-73" data-timestamp="47:34" class="neutral">but but their credit spreads above the real interest rate and those things have have gotten smaller and most of the borrowing is by people who are risky borrowers not riskless borrowers and so I'm wondering since that drives the economy the risky borrowers do you think in the future um or maybe even now the FED is playing close attention to its effect on spreads and how its interest rate moves might affect spreads and thereby affect the economy spreads always come into play usually the classic thing is the tighter they get the looser the policy The Wider they get the tighter the policy there's lots of factors that go in determining spreads uh for example just the econom is doing really well despite how high we have rates and that that's going to tend to push down spreads all by itself independent of what we do you have a lot of money coming in in private credit This Is wealth coming in from outside the traditional lending coming into the markets and what that's going to tend to do is drive down credit spreads no matter what I do that's just entry of new credit sources coming in to fund these firms so one has to be careful about what's causing the tightening spread so it's not necessarily loose monitor</p>

<p><span id="sentence-74" data-timestamp="48:43" class="neutral">last question now we're out of time yeah we we we should run over to to the okay all right but John you had great question the best was to come we're gonna we're gonna open it up 35 questions we got we stay here tonight be here yeah so I'm gonna put my I'm looking for a hand okay right here in the front row sir yeah we do have mics</p>

<p><span id="sentence-75" data-timestamp="49:04" class="neutral">um this is Gan Dan from C Securities uh thank you very much for the opportunity today um I recall on October 18th um last year um you said um if we saw inflation coming down to two and a half Taylor rule would say cut rates um in the most recent SCP the medium forecast for corc this year has shifted from 2.4 to 2.6 while the median dots still see three Cuts this year do you um think now you can start cutting rates even before the inflation hit two and a half or do you still think there's a reasonable chance for the inflation number to come down to 2.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-76" data-timestamp="49:37" class="neutral">5 and start cutting around the say mid year before um see some potential rebounding into the year</p>

<p><span id="sentence-77" data-timestamp="50:14" class="neutral bold">yeah so I made those comments after a speech and a Q&A back in November and the thing that people I think back it's like I said something along the lines that if we see this type of data this good data for three four five months we could start thinking about cutting the rids we got two months the If part don't forget the If part in that original statement everybody seemed to ignore the If part but it was an if statement and it didn't happen so there's no inconsistency between what I said in November because we only got two months of good data and then we got the January number the February number and they just don't support moving that fast now I do think that infl I that inflation is going to come down again off these last two months and if that happens we can then go back and start saying okay it's just a later start okay those extra good two months just came after two bad months so then it's just a question of when do you start not sort</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-78" data-timestamp="50:50" class="neutral">of the the original argument still holds it's just how much data you need to make yourself confident that you can lower your rise</p>

<p><span id="sentence-79" data-timestamp="51:26" class="neutral">okay we'll take uh one more over here and then we're going to go that side yes sir hi uh Brian at Chase portfolio um so I think a lot of what you said makes a ton of sense you've got new data um you talk a lot about know participants moving forecast up as a result so I think it's is it safe to say then that you move yourself um in terms of dot projections I don't talk about my dots and I'm not going to start now fair enough I just talk about the distribution of the of the of dots head definitely kind of crept up certainly at the bottom end much fewer cuts by the more dsh members of the committee and uh I just we're just taking that information into account but it's not shifting our overall view so that's why I really wanted to stress yesp showed we're not overreacting but we are reacting it's not like we're ignoring it saying who cares ignore that no we take it very seriously we we you know if it had been one month and it went back down to 0.2 we would have probably said okay that that's just a oneof but we have to see we just need to have more time and that was the second part of my question a couple of months you Ed that same language a bit over a month ago does that take May um for first move off the table today couple months is a couple months we'll get two more reports before may could be maybe not depends</p>

<p><span id="sentence-80" data-timestamp="52:36" class="neutral">this is where I'm going to do the ambiguity Ed sometime back there was a lot of discussion of quantitative tightening seems to S dropped off the the tables not discuss that much does it really matter and what's the where's the FED with respect to quanti tightening now yeah so there was a conference here just three weeks ago that I talked about that there the paper was about quantitative tiing I and Governor or president Logan discussed the paper that paper found there was like very little evidence of quantitative tightening on interest rates and it there's a sense in which if you do easing interest rates come down and when you do tightening they should go back up that it's symmetric so one of the points I try to make is that's not necessarily how things work that you can push the rates down and then later when things settle down you can take that liquidity out and you don't cause rates to necessar go back up my little analogy was you know when a house is on fire and the fire department shows up and puts out the fire when you drain all the water away the house doesn't start back up on fire that's what I mean by asymmetry of the</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-81" data-timestamp="53:42" class="neutral">effects putting it on did one thing taking it off had a different effect so the QT like I said most of the evidence shows that it's kind of like the fire you're just draining the liquidity that you needed at the time but when you drain it out and it's not really needed you're not really going to have real major effects on the financial markets in the economy Colin if your questions very short we can do it thank you Barbara um Governor Waller you uh you commented in your remarks about the kind of mixed messages in the</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-82" data-timestamp="54:16" class="neutral">or in the employment data in particular on the potentially negative side of the unemployment rate ticking up to 3.9% uh maybe it's just noise in youth unemployment as as you mentioned uh to the extent that the unemployment rate for whatever reason uh does continue to increase you know looking at the sep the median for the next several years is four 4.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-83" data-timestamp="54:40" class="neutral">1 uh like is if it goes a little bit above that is that concerning or how do you decide that uh that's a like a problem</p>

<p><span id="sentence-84" data-timestamp="55:04" class="neutral">yeah so when I did the speech back in May of 22 with the beverage curve I said you know if we get vacancy rate down to four and a half job to unemploy or the vacancy to unemployment ratio backed down to 1.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-85" data-timestamp="55:39" class="neutral">2 our model and of course it's a model said unemployment would go up between 4.2 and 4.4 so we fully expected it to creep and go up above four uh and that would was what I referred to is kind of a soft Landing so it doesn't mean in unemployment stays at 3.7 the whole time that was like way out of the realm of possibility but so it's not surprising to me that if unemployment creeps up a been over four that there's any reason to panic okay well thank you
