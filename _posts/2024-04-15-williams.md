title: Williams Says Fed Policy Is in a Good Place as Inflation Gradually Slows
categories: Fedspeak
tags: [policy, QT, Williams]
article_excerpt: "New York Fed President John Williams said the economy remains strong with solid job growth and real wage gains, but inflation is coming down slower than expected. 'Overall, I think the picture is one that the economy is getting in better balance,' Williams said. He is optimistic about the economy's potential growth, citing increases in labor force participation and productivity. Williams believes 'monetary policy is in a good place,' noting that real interest rates are considerably higher now due to lower inflation. Williams anticipates a gradual process of bringing rates back to normal levels, likely starting this year. 'We will need to start a process at some point to bring interest rates back to more normal levels. And my own view is that we will you know, that process will likely start this year, but again, it will be driven, driven by the data and achieving our goals,' he said. He emphasized that current policy is 'restrictive' and 'in a good place.' On the balance sheet, Williams said the Fed is 'decreasing the balance sheet quite rapidly' but slowing the pace 'makes a lot of sense' as a 'prudent course of action.' He noted the runoff is 'going exactly as planned.'"

#### Q&A Transcript

<p><span id="sentence-1" data-timestamp="00:00" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> Numbers just came out pretty amazing.</span> <span id="sentence-2" data-timestamp="00:03" class="neutral">Are you continually surprised by the American consumer?</span></p>
<p><span id="sentence-3" data-timestamp="00:06" class="neutral"><strong>John Williams:</strong> Well, first of all, welcome to the New York Fed.</span> <span id="sentence-4" data-timestamp="00:09" class="neutral">We're celebrating the 100th anniversary of this building here on Liberty Street.</span> <span id="sentence-5" data-timestamp="00:13" class="neutral bold">So consumer spending has been strong.</span> <span id="sentence-6" data-timestamp="00:15" class="neutral bold">I think it is driven by strong fundamentals.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-7" data-timestamp="00:18" class="hawkish bold">Job growth has been solid.</span> <span id="sentence-8" data-timestamp="00:20" class="hawkish bold">We've seen real wage gains.</span> <span id="sentence-9" data-timestamp="00:22" class="hawkish bold">We have we're in a pretty strong economy with good growth.</span> <span id="sentence-10" data-timestamp="00:26" class="neutral">So, yes, it is part of that story.</span> <span id="sentence-11" data-timestamp="00:28" class="dovish bold">But, you know, I think what we're realizing is we're getting a nice tailwind from the supply side of the economy with good labor force growth, strong productivity, good real wage gains.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-12" data-timestamp="00:40" class="neutral">So with that, I think, you know, consumers are spending.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-13" data-timestamp="00:43" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> What's the thinking in your office and among your colleagues about does this last or is this a surprise that you think could go away at any minute?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-14" data-timestamp="00:53" class="neutral"><strong>John Williams:</strong> Well, one thing that makes it really hard to forecast is we're still feeling the effects of the after effects of the pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine and all the things that have happened in between.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-15" data-timestamp="01:01" class="neutral">So we're definitely still seeing an adjustment process by the consumer, by in the economy overall.</span> <span id="sentence-16" data-timestamp="01:08" class="hawkish bold">But overall, I think that the economy will continue to grow at a solid rate this year, probably not as high as the 3.1% we saw last year, but something like 2% or around that.</span> <span id="sentence-17" data-timestamp="01:18" class="hawkish">So I feel like we're still in a good place, probably not as rapid of growth as we saw last year.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-18" data-timestamp="01:22" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> Speaking of international events, I have to ask you, the Middle East going on right now.</span> <span id="sentence-19" data-timestamp="01:27" class="neutral">How do you think about the economic and policy implications of these events?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-20" data-timestamp="01:35" class="neutral"><strong>John Williams:</strong> Right.</span> <span id="sentence-21" data-timestamp="01:35" class="neutral">So obviously, we're watching this very carefully.</span> <span id="sentence-22" data-timestamp="01:38" class="neutral">I think the primary way you see it to.</span> <span id="sentence-23" data-timestamp="01:40" class="neutral">How is, first of all, through commodity prices.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-24" data-timestamp="01:43" class="dovish">But second is what we think of as a flight to safety, where investors, when they see risks in the global economy, they tend to bring money to the US dollar and that tends to push yields down somewhat.</span> <span id="sentence-25" data-timestamp="01:56" class="neutral bold">Right now, I think, you know, markets are pretty, pretty stable.</span> <span id="sentence-26" data-timestamp="01:59" class="neutral">We're not seeing big movements in that way.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-27" data-timestamp="02:01" class="neutral">But generally that's the way I would... what I would expect to see when you see heightened geopolitical tensions.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-28" data-timestamp="02:09" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> When you think about what the markets are reacting to and what could come out of this, is this more of an inflation worry or a growth concern?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-29" data-timestamp="02:20" class="neutral"><strong>John Williams:</strong> Well, I it's really hard to say.</span> <span id="sentence-30" data-timestamp="02:22" class="neutral">It really depends on how the situation evolves.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-31" data-timestamp="02:24" class="neutral">Right now, I don't think of this as maybe in the near term, it could be effects of financial conditions in commodity prices, as I mentioned.</span> <span id="sentence-32" data-timestamp="02:34" class="neutral">I don't see this as a major driver of the overall forecast or outlook for economic growth or for inflation.</span></p>
<p><span id="sentence-33" data-timestamp="02:40" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> Speaking of inflation, CPI came in much hotter than expected and sort of freaked everybody out on Wall Street.</span> <span id="sentence-34" data-timestamp="02:47" class="neutral">And markets sort of took that as a turning point in Fed policy.</span> <span id="sentence-35" data-timestamp="02:50" class="dovish bold">Do you see it that way?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-36" data-timestamp="02:51" class="dovish bold"><strong>John Williams:</strong> I don't see it as a turning point.</span> <span id="sentence-37" data-timestamp="02:53" class="dovish bold">I think that, you know, we've we saw inflation come down maybe quicker than we expected last year.</span> <span id="sentence-38" data-timestamp="02:59" class="hawkish bold">We definitely saw really a lower readings in inflation in the final six months that I never thought that that was going to stay that low.</span> <span id="sentence-39" data-timestamp="03:05" class="neutral">That was kind of unusually low.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-40" data-timestamp="03:07" class="hawkish bold">We're now seeing some and a little bit unusually high readings.</span> <span id="sentence-41" data-timestamp="03:10" class="dovish bold">Overall, I think the picture is one that the economy is getting in better balance.</span> <span id="sentence-42" data-timestamp="03:17" class="hawkish bold">We still have a strong labor market and we're seeing inflation gradually come down.</span> <span id="sentence-43" data-timestamp="03:22" class="neutral">Now, I do think that, you know, for me, what do I see in the data?</span> <span id="sentence-44" data-timestamp="03:25" class="hawkish bold">Well, the economy and you pointed out the retail sales today, but more broadly, the economy continues to be strong.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-45" data-timestamp="03:32" class="hawkish bold">Again. I think we're being helped by strong demand and supply.</span> <span id="sentence-46" data-timestamp="03:35" class="hawkish">And those are helping, you know, growth.</span> <span id="sentence-47" data-timestamp="03:37" class="dovish bold">And we're seeing, you know, inflation come down a little bit slower than expected.</span> <span id="sentence-48" data-timestamp="03:42" class="neutral">And so, you know, I think markets are taking all of that information into account in how they how they expect policy to be.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-49" data-timestamp="03:48" class="neutral">For me, I'm, you know, data dependent, as always, really take the totality of the data and think about what it means for achieving our maximum employment and price stability goals.</span> <span id="sentence-50" data-timestamp="04:00" class="dovish">So I don't see this as a a game changer or anything.</span> <span id="sentence-51" data-timestamp="04:03" class="neutral">I do think it's important information that will clearly, you know, affect my thinking in my forecast.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-52" data-timestamp="04:11" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> Even those who have thought about what PCE might be after the PPI and CPI, inflation isn't coming down rapidly any more.</span> <span id="sentence-53" data-timestamp="04:15" class="hawkish bold">But you do have the strong growth.</span> <span id="sentence-54" data-timestamp="04:21" class="hawkish bold">You have very low unemployment.</span> <span id="sentence-55" data-timestamp="04:23" class="neutral">Why cut rates if the economy is doing fine at this level?</span></p>
<p><span id="sentence-56" data-timestamp="04:20" class="hawkish bold"><strong>John Williams:</strong> Well, first of all, I think monetary policy is working at the rates we have now.</span> <span id="sentence-57" data-timestamp="04:28" class="hawkish bold">So I think I think monetary policy is in a good place over the past 12 to 18 months.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-58" data-timestamp="04:32" class="dovish bold">We've seen all pretty much all the measures of imbalances in the labor market enter our economy recede, many of them back to levels we saw in 2018 or 2019.</span> <span id="sentence-59" data-timestamp="04:40" class="dovish">So we're seeing that, you know, restoring balance in the economy.</span> <span id="sentence-60" data-timestamp="04:45" class="dovish bold">We are seeing a slow decline in inflation.</span> <span id="sentence-61" data-timestamp="04:50" class="hawkish bold">So I do think monetary policy right now is in a in a good place.</span> <span id="sentence-62" data-timestamp="04:53" class="neutral">I'm not fixated on where do rates need to go over the next year.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-63" data-timestamp="04:55" class="neutral">What I'm focused on is how do we best achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals?</span> <span id="sentence-64" data-timestamp="05:00" class="hawkish bold">The data we're seeing show the economy strong, and that's really good news and labor markets strong.</span> <span id="sentence-65" data-timestamp="05:06" class="dovish">At the same time, we are getting a better balance and we're seeing some declining overall inflation.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-66" data-timestamp="05:12" class="neutral">So for me, it's really about getting that right.</span> <span id="sentence-67" data-timestamp="05:14" class="neutral bold">And then whatever we need to do to adjust monetary policy, we can do to best continue the progress towards our goals.</span> <span id="sentence-68" data-timestamp="05:20" class="neutral">So that's how I'm thinking about it.</span> <span id="sentence-69" data-timestamp="05:23" class="neutral">And we just have to keep watching the data and make the decisions based on those goals.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-70" data-timestamp="05:28" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> What is your base case that you will cut rates this year?</span></p>
<p><span id="sentence-71" data-timestamp="05:24" class="dovish bold"><strong>John Williams:</strong> My own view is I think that with inflation continuing to gradually come down and I would guess I would say gradually is the operative word here.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-72" data-timestamp="05:34" class="hawkish bold">And with the economy remaining strong, I do think that given where the level of rates are, real interest rates now are considerably higher than they were before because inflation has come down quite a bit.</span> <span id="sentence-73" data-timestamp="05:47" class="dovish bold">So we will need to start a process at some point to bring interest rates back to more normal levels.</span> <span id="sentence-74" data-timestamp="05:55" class="dovish bold">And my own view is that we will you know, that process will likely start this year, but again, it will be driven, driven by the data and achieving our goals.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-75" data-timestamp="06:07" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> So it's possible you don't do anything this year.</span></p>
<p><span id="sentence-76" data-timestamp="06:28" class="neutral"><strong>John Williams:</strong> Well, again, you're asking me to speculate on what will happen, of course.</span> <span id="sentence-77" data-timestamp="06:32" class="hawkish bold">And, you know, right now I think monetary policy is in a good place where we're seeing the but we're seeing progress.</span> <span id="sentence-78" data-timestamp="06:38" class="dovish bold">It's a bumpy road on the inflation front.</span> <span id="sentence-79" data-timestamp="06:41" class="neutral bold">And we'll just have to figure out how to best adjust policy as needed to achieve our goals.</span> 
  <p><span id="sentence-80" data-timestamp="06:45" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> You mentioned the real rate.</span><span id="sentence-81" data-timestamp="06:46" class="neutral">Is policy tight now?</span></p>
  
<p><span id="sentence-82" data-timestamp="06:48" class="hawkish bold"><strong>John Williams:</strong> I do think we have restrictive monetary policy.</span> <span id="sentence-83" data-timestamp="06:51" class="hawkish bold">I do think policy is tight.</span> <span id="sentence-84" data-timestamp="06:53" class="neutral">So how do I what do I look for?</span> <span id="sentence-85" data-timestamp="06:55" class="hawkish">Because the economy's growing.</span> <span id="sentence-86" data-timestamp="06:57" class="hawkish bold">It grew over 3%.</span> <span id="sentence-87" data-timestamp="07:00" class="hawkish bold">You know, we're adding about, what, 275,000 jobs over the first three months.</span> <span id="sentence-88" data-timestamp="07:05" class="hawkish">So that seems like an economy that's really strong and not being held back by monetary policy.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-89" data-timestamp="07:13" class="dovish bold">But if you take a step back, all these measures of imbalances in the labor market, whether job openings or wage rates or quits rates or all the other indicators we look at, all of them are moving from being very tight to less tied, and most of them back to a more strong labor market or getting closer there.</span> <span id="sentence-90" data-timestamp="07:31" class="dovish bold">I mean, job openings are still high, wage growth is still a bit high, but these are all moving in the right direction.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-91" data-timestamp="07:39" class="dovish bold">So I think the stance on monetary policy is really been an important driver of restoring balance in the economy and helping bring inflation to 2% towards 2%.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-92" data-timestamp="07:49" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> What's left with inflation?</span> <span id="sentence-93" data-timestamp="07:51" class="neutral">Is it something that you can affect or are these non interest rate responsive sectors?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-94" data-timestamp="07:57" class="neutral bold"><strong>John Williams:</strong> You know, monetary policy can affect inflation in the economy.</span> <span id="sentence-95" data-timestamp="08:00" class="neutral bold">It works through multiple channels.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-96" data-timestamp="08:02" class="neutral">So there are some sectors that maybe are not as interest sensitive, but the economy is interest rate sensitive.</span> <span id="sentence-97" data-timestamp="08:09" class="dovish bold">We've seen that over the past couple of years as we've moved from an accommodative policy to a restrictive policy.</span> <span id="sentence-98" data-timestamp="08:15" class="hawkish bold">So monetary policy is working as expected, to continue to work to to bring inflation down.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-99" data-timestamp="08:23" class="neutral">You're going to see it, you know, show up in different parts of the inflation, you know, goods versus services and things.</span> <span id="sentence-100" data-timestamp="08:30" class="dovish bold">But over the past year, year and a half, we have seen a broad based decline in inflation in all of these categories.</span> <span id="sentence-101" data-timestamp="08:39" class="dovish bold">It's just that we haven't gotten all the way to 2%.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-102" data-timestamp="08:42" class="neutral bold">And we just need to keep policy in the right place to achieve that 2% goal.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-103" data-timestamp="08:47" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> Question I always ask is what are CEOs companies telling you these days about their hiring plans, about what they're having to pay and about inflation, whether they're raising prices or having to pay higher prices?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-104" data-timestamp="09:02" class="neutral"><strong>John Williams:</strong> Well, clearly, if you asked me this question a year or two ago, that's all they would be talking about.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-105" data-timestamp="09:09" class="hawkish">Price increases, compensation increases, the challenges of hiring employees today.</span> <span id="sentence-106" data-timestamp="09:16" class="dovish">I think those you know, those comments are still out there a little bit, but far less than before.</span> <span id="sentence-107" data-timestamp="09:21" class="dovish bold">We're hearing from our contacts, you know, that it's easier to fill positions than it used to be.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-108" data-timestamp="09:27" class="dovish bold">Wage compensation pressures are less and price pressures are are less.</span> <span id="sentence-109" data-timestamp="09:33" class="dovish">I think that's consistent with what we're seeing overall in the data.</span></p>
<p><span id="sentence-110" data-timestamp="09:36" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> You're the potential growth guy.</span> <span id="sentence-111" data-timestamp="09:38" class="neutral">Has potential growth moved up?</span> 
  
<p><span id="sentence-112" data-timestamp="09:40" class="hawkish"><strong>John Williams:</strong> You know, I am getting more optimistic about potential growth in the economy, I think for a couple reasons.</span> <span id="sentence-113" data-timestamp="09:47" class="neutral">One is, you know, through the pandemic and everything that happened after that, I, like most people, had concerns that the supply side of the economy had had suffered, you know, damage the labor force and in terms of labor force participation.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-114" data-timestamp="10:06" class="hawkish bold"> And, you know, as we've watched the data over the past few years, we've seen an increase in labor force participation, increase in labor force growth, and we've seen a rebound in productivity.</span> <span id="sentence-115" data-timestamp="10:19" class="hawkish">Now, I'm not saying that we're in some, you know, new high growth kind of world, but I do think a potential growth is probably closer to 2% or a little higher, which is well above a lot of estimates in the past few years.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-116" data-timestamp="10:37" class="hawkish">And that's a very positive sign for us real incomes and for the economy and obviously for helping get inflation down.</span></p>
<p><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> <span id="sentence-117" data-timestamp="10:44" class="neutral">A question for all of our friends around us on trading desks.</span> <span id="sentence-118" data-timestamp="10:48" class="neutral">You had a briefing on QT at the last meeting from the Fed staff and members, according to the minutes, generally agreed that it should start soon.</span><span id="sentence-119" data-timestamp="11:01" class="neutral">Does that mean may or does that mean June?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-120" data-timestamp="11:04" class="neutral"><strong>John Williams:</strong> Well, I think we said fairly soon.</span> <span id="sentence-121" data-timestamp="11:06" class="neutral bold">And the you know, I think that the reasoning for slowing the pace of reduction of our balance sheet makes a lot of sense.</span> <span id="sentence-122" data-timestamp="11:14" class="neutral bold">It's a prudent course of action.</span> <span id="sentence-123" data-timestamp="11:17" class="neutral bold">We are decreasing the balance sheet quite rapidly.</span> <span id="sentence-124" data-timestamp="11:20" class="neutral bold">And and by slowing that, we'll have more ability to monitor, assess and analyze as we get eventually to an ample reserves kind of world that we're aiming for.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-125" data-timestamp="11:34" class="neutral bold">Everything is going with the balance sheet.</span> <span id="sentence-126" data-timestamp="11:36" class="neutral">Everything is going exactly as planned and things are going well when we decide to slow the pace of the balance sheet.</span> <span id="sentence-127" data-timestamp="11:43" class="neutral">That's a decision for the committee.</span> <span id="sentence-128" data-timestamp="11:45" class="neutral">No decision was made at the last meeting, but obviously we'll get together relatively soon and discuss this further.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-129" data-timestamp="11:55" class="neutral bold">But to me, this is a sign of success of the plans we laid out almost two years ago to reduce the balance sheet.</span> <span id="sentence-130" data-timestamp="12:02" class="neutral bold">We've had very little disruption in markets.</span> <span id="sentence-131" data-timestamp="12:04" class="neutral bold">It's worked exactly as planned, and we're just executing on that plan and that's going very smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span id="sentence-132" data-timestamp="12:11" class="neutral"><strong>Michael McKee:</strong> So it could come before rate moves.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-133" data-timestamp="12:13" class="neutral bold"><strong>John Williams:</strong> You know, these are really separate issues.</span> <span id="sentence-134" data-timestamp="12:16" class="neutral">I mean, our numbers are shrinking the balance sheet.</span> <span id="sentence-135" data-timestamp="12:19" class="neutral bold">We're focused on getting to ample reserves on monetary policy.</span> <span id="sentence-136" data-timestamp="12:23" class="neutral bold">We're very focused on achieving our maximum employment and price stability goals.</span> <span id="sentence-137" data-timestamp="12:28" class="neutral">Those are different objectives.</span> <span id="sentence-138" data-timestamp="12:30" class="neutral bold">Those instruments can obviously move in different times in different ways.</span></p>
