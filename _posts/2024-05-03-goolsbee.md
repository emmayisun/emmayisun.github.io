title: Goolsbee Sees Solid Job Market, But Bumpy Inflation Path Clouds Rate Cut Timing
categories: Fedspeak
tags: [policy, Goolsbee]
article_excerpt: "Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee expressed optimism about the job market, stating that the recent 175,000 jobs report is 'very solid' and 'clearly moving back into something that looks like pre-COVID and conventional times.' However, he remains cautious about rate cuts, saying 'I don't like committing to in our hands of even for the next meeting, much less when it comes to the fall and going into next year.' Goolsbee acknowledged that inflation 'hit a bump for sure at the start of the year' and emphasized the need to ensure it's not a sign of economic reacceleration. He believes current monetary policy is restrictive, noting 'if you look at the real federal funds rate, it's high. It's as high as it's been in some decades.' Goolsbee also warned that remaining overly restrictive for too long could negatively impact employment, stating 'If we remain as restrictive as this for too long, we're in my view, definitely going to have to be thinking about the employment side of the mandate.'"

<p><span id="sentence-1" data-timestamp="00:00" class="neutral">Welcome to the campus of Stanford University, the Hoover Institution's Monetary Policy Conference.</span> <span id="sentence-2" data-timestamp="00:07" class="neutral">And we're very excited this morning to have with us Austan Goolsbee, who is the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank.</span> <span id="sentence-3" data-timestamp="00:15" class="neutral">Thank you for making time for us this morning when all of a sudden the disappointment that the markets had on Wednesday went away.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-4" data-timestamp="00:23" class="neutral bold">Everybody's happy this morning because jobs came in lower than expected, 175,000.</span> <span id="sentence-5" data-timestamp="00:28" class="neutral bold">What was your reaction?</span> <span id="sentence-6" data-timestamp="00:30" class="neutral bold">Well, I mean, 175,000 is a very solid report.</span> <span id="sentence-7" data-timestamp="00:35" class="neutral">The sum of the root of our of our frictions here might be there's a it's kind of a day traders timetable and there's an economic timetable for setting monetary policy.</span> <span id="sentence-8" data-timestamp="00:44" class="neutral">Of course, you got to take a longer arc view on inflation, on employment.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-9" data-timestamp="00:49" class="dovish">And we're just trying to figure out after the excellent dual mandate performance of 2023, let's call it where inflation fell almost as much as it has fallen on record, and it did so without a recession.</span> <span id="sentence-10" data-timestamp="01:04" class="dovish">How much can we continue that into 2024?</span> <span id="sentence-11" data-timestamp="01:07" class="hawkish bold">We hit a bump for sure at the start of the year on the inflation front.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-12" data-timestamp="01:17" class="neutral">And now everybody's just got to take a step back and try to figure out, is that a sign that the economy's overheating or is that a sign of some other thing?</span> <span id="sentence-13" data-timestamp="01:26" class="dovish bold">The more jobs reports you get like this where they're solid, but it's clearly moving back into something that looks like pre-COVID and conventional times, the more confident we can be that the economy's not overheating.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-14" data-timestamp="01:43" class="neutral">But we just got to we got to just got to watch this.</span> <span id="sentence-15" data-timestamp="01:46" class="neutral">You are one of the I don't want to use the word dovish, but more optimistic people about the possibility that rates could be cut this year.</span> <span id="sentence-16" data-timestamp="01:54" class="neutral">How do you feel now?</span> <span id="sentence-17" data-timestamp="01:56" class="neutral">We do see this slowdown.</span> <span id="sentence-18" data-timestamp="01:59" class="neutral">The IASB numbers show slowdowns.</span> <span id="sentence-19" data-timestamp="02:01" class="neutral">Spending numbers were lower than anticipated and lower than in the last quarter.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-20" data-timestamp="02:06" class="neutral">Are we setting up to go back to the idea that rate cuts are going to happen this year?</span> <span id="sentence-21" data-timestamp="02:11" class="neutral bold">I don't like committing to in our hands of even for the next meeting, much less when it comes to the fall and going into next year.</span> <span id="sentence-22" data-timestamp="02:20" class="dovish">I will say the I was optimistic in 2023 that we could hit what I was calling the Golden Path, that there were reasons why in an unprecedented way we potentially could get inflation down significantly without having a big recession, which previous 220, 23.</span> <span id="sentence-23" data-timestamp="02:39" class="dovish">That really doesn't happen.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-24" data-timestamp="02:44" class="dovish">We did that in 23 as we're looking in 24.</span> <span id="sentence-25" data-timestamp="02:49" class="hawkish bold">Like I said, we we clearly hit a bump at the start of this year and we've just got to get comfort that it's not a sign of of a re acceleration of the economy.</span> <span id="sentence-26" data-timestamp="03:00" class="neutral">And we got some cross-currents going.</span> <span id="sentence-27" data-timestamp="03:03" class="neutral">There's no question about that.</span> <span id="sentence-28" data-timestamp="03:05" class="neutral bold">I think that's what's happened so far in the job market this year is a little colored by you.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-29" data-timestamp="03:17" class="neutral">You got to take into account that we actually had significantly more immigration than we anticipated or then we thought at the time.</span> <span id="sentence-30" data-timestamp="03:28" class="neutral">So everything's got to kind of be normed to a per capita basis, and that makes aggregate numbers like aggregate GDP growth or aggregate consumption or aggregate payroll growth.</span> <span id="sentence-31" data-timestamp="03:39" class="neutral">You got to scale it down a bit.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-32" data-timestamp="03:43" class="neutral">And we're still trying to wrap our head around how much what about the idea of the need to raise rates?</span> <span id="sentence-33" data-timestamp="03:49" class="neutral">The chairman was asked about it a number of times on Wednesday, said it didn't seem like something that was going to happen.</span> <span id="sentence-34" data-timestamp="03:55" class="neutral bold">Is it at all on the table for you?</span> <span id="sentence-35" data-timestamp="03:57" class="neutral bold">Look, like I say, I don't like speculating when we're going to get a lot of information before the next meeting and before all the meetings for the rest of the year in a unclear way.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-36" data-timestamp="04:15" class="dovish">I say don't think that nothing is never not on the table.</span> <span id="sentence-37" data-timestamp="04:19" class="neutral">You know, the job of a central banker is to be paranoid about everything at all times and to have thought through plans and how could we react to different circumstances.</span> <span id="sentence-38" data-timestamp="04:30" class="neutral">So it's not productive to say something's not on the table ever.</span> <span id="sentence-39" data-timestamp="04:35" class="neutral">Something is on the table.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-40" data-timestamp="04:37" class="neutral">I just think it's we're going to we're going to find out this data, these data and the key element on the economic timetable, not the market trading timetable is are we continuing the progress slow and steady that we saw last year, or is some other thing happening that we're accelerating the more jobs numbers like the ones we saw today?</span> <span id="sentence-41" data-timestamp="05:00" class="neutral">De The more you see easing of inflation, the more comfort we would have.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-42" data-timestamp="05:08" class="neutral">I would have on the committee, I don't speak for anybody else and if it goes the other way, will react to that.</span> <span id="sentence-43" data-timestamp="05:15" class="neutral">You know, that's the that's the Midwestern way is there is no bad weather.</span> <span id="sentence-44" data-timestamp="05:19" class="neutral">There's only bad clothing.</span> <span id="sentence-45" data-timestamp="05:21" class="neutral">You know, we will deal with it.</span> <span id="sentence-46" data-timestamp="05:23" class="neutral">I mean, we're we're out here at Stanford.</span> <span id="sentence-47" data-timestamp="05:25" class="neutral">There's definitely no bad weather.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-48" data-timestamp="05:27" class="neutral">But back in Chicago, you know, it's different.</span> <span id="sentence-49" data-timestamp="05:31" class="neutral">Well, to drill down on that a little bit.</span> <span id="sentence-50" data-timestamp="05:34" class="neutral bold">The question then becomes, do you think monetary policy is tight enough?</span> <span id="sentence-51" data-timestamp="05:38" class="neutral bold">And if so, how do you square that with the idea that inflation has started going up again?</span> <span id="sentence-52" data-timestamp="05:44" class="hawkish bold">There's two separate parts to that.</span> <span id="sentence-53" data-timestamp="05:46" class="hawkish bold">The first is how restrictive is monetary policy?</span> <span id="sentence-54" data-timestamp="05:49" class="hawkish bold">I think it's restrictive.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-55" data-timestamp="05:51" class="hawkish bold">I think if you look at the real federal funds rate, it's high.</span> <span id="sentence-56" data-timestamp="05:55" class="hawkish bold">It's as high as it's been in some decades.</span> <span id="sentence-57" data-timestamp="05:58" class="hawkish bold">And I think that lately, if you look at the interests, interest rate, sensitive parts of the economy, you see that restrictiveness.</span> <span id="sentence-58" data-timestamp="06:08" class="neutral bold">The second part of the question is, well, then what happened with inflation?</span> <span id="sentence-59" data-timestamp="06:13" class="neutral bold">And I think the answer but that's partly what we're trying to find out is there's a whole lot of other things besides monetary policy and besides the aggregate stated demand that drive inflation rates.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-60" data-timestamp="06:25" class="neutral">And you've definitely seen things happening on the supply side of the economy with shipping and bridges and canals, shutdowns and things like that.</span> <span id="sentence-61" data-timestamp="06:35" class="neutral">Commodity prices, you've seen movement, energy prices, you've seen movement.</span> <span id="sentence-62" data-timestamp="06:40" class="neutral">And so we've just got to get a better, more comfort, I think, on this question of are we on the long arc that we saw all of last year and especially the second half of last year, where inflation's steadily coming down or are we in some different environment?</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-63" data-timestamp="07:00" class="neutral">And that's what we're if you're in some different environment, is it things that monetary policy can affect?</span> <span id="sentence-64" data-timestamp="07:07" class="neutral">It might be, you know, if it's all supply shock.</span> <span id="sentence-65" data-timestamp="07:10" class="neutral">Probably not.</span> <span id="sentence-66" data-timestamp="07:11" class="neutral">I mean, we we kind of saw that dynamic play out at the beginning of the pandemic when the supply chains shut down.</span> <span id="sentence-67" data-timestamp="07:18" class="neutral">So that that's a that's another important aspect that's in this in this effort.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-68" data-timestamp="07:29" class="neutral">You know, as I kind of say, that everyone thinks it's a battle between dovish ness and hawkishness, but it's really it's not about the birds, it's the data dogs.</span> <span id="sentence-69" data-timestamp="07:39" class="neutral">And the first rule of the data dogs is know when to walk and know when to sniff.</span> <span id="sentence-70" data-timestamp="07:45" class="neutral">And, you know, the time to sniff is when you're we're trying to figure these out.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-71" data-timestamp="07:50" class="neutral">Well, when you look at the overall economy, we mentioned earlier that we're seeing some slowdown.</span> <span id="sentence-72" data-timestamp="07:56" class="neutral">Fed officials have said we can wait because the economy is in good shape.</span> <span id="sentence-73" data-timestamp="08:01" class="hawkish bold">But how much do you worry that you're going to slow the economy too much?</span> <span id="sentence-74" data-timestamp="08:05" class="hawkish bold">And because things like unemployment are a lagging indicator that you'll find yourself with really slow growth or recession before you can react?</span> <span id="sentence-75" data-timestamp="08:15" class="neutral bold">Look, that's the balance that you have to strike, that delicate balance.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-76" data-timestamp="08:20" class="neutral">That's the that's the dual mandate.</span> <span id="sentence-77" data-timestamp="08:23" class="hawkish">And there was a time when the job market was explosively hot and inflation was well off the chart in worse than we wanted.</span> <span id="sentence-78" data-timestamp="08:34" class="hawkish">And there's no balance in an environment like that.</span> <span id="sentence-79" data-timestamp="08:38" class="hawkish">You're just trying to get the inflation rate down.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-80" data-timestamp="08:47" class="dovish bold">If we remain as restrictive as this for too long, we're in my view, definitely going to have to be thinking about the employment side of the mandate.</span> <span id="sentence-81" data-timestamp="08:56" class="neutral">So far, we've got some cross-currents going.</span> <span id="sentence-82" data-timestamp="08:59" class="neutral bold">As I say, the job numbers today are solid.</span> <span id="sentence-83" data-timestamp="09:03" class="dovish">There's not in a previous world, if you said you're getting jobs numbers in 175,000 200,000 range, people be quite happy with that.</span> <span id="sentence-84" data-timestamp="09:10" class="neutral">So we'll just have to see.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-85" data-timestamp="09:13" class="neutral">It is true that in normal times, when the business cycle turns the wrong way, it doesn't do so.</span> <span id="sentence-86" data-timestamp="09:21" class="neutral">It's not subtle, there's no subtlety about it.</span> <span id="sentence-87" data-timestamp="09:24" class="hawkish">The unemployment rate goes up quite significantly.</span> <span id="sentence-88" data-timestamp="09:27" class="hawkish">You see your credit delinquencies deteriorate a lot.</span> <span id="sentence-89" data-timestamp="09:31" class="hawkish">You see durable goods manufacturing, which are and other cyclically sensitive sectors deteriorate it in a noticeable way.</span> <span id="sentence-90" data-timestamp="09:40" class="dovish">And you haven't really seen that.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-91" data-timestamp="09:45" class="neutral">And that's part of where we're that's part of where we're monitoring.</span> <span id="sentence-92" data-timestamp="09:49" class="neutral">You have a manufacturing intensive district, but also a lot of services.</span> <span id="sentence-93" data-timestamp="09:54" class="neutral">What are CEOs telling you about their vision for what's coming?</span> <span id="sentence-94" data-timestamp="10:00" class="neutral">And they're.</span> <span id="sentence-95" data-timestamp="10:01" class="neutral">Planning in terms of employment and in terms of prices.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-96" data-timestamp="10:05" class="neutral">As you point out, the Chicago Fed's district is the most manufacturing intensity of all the Fed, and four of the five most manufacturing intensive states are in the are in the district.</span> <span id="sentence-97" data-timestamp="10:18" class="neutral">Our business contacts on the manufacturing side mostly they convey more of the same that that 2024 it's not accelerating.</span> <span id="sentence-98" data-timestamp="10:27" class="neutral">It's not decelerating.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-99" data-timestamp="10:33" class="neutral">They're just trudging along in a decent environment.</span> <span id="sentence-100" data-timestamp="10:37" class="neutral">I think we still are seeing play out We've we got past the supply chain bottlenecks.</span> <span id="sentence-101" data-timestamp="10:44" class="neutral">You don't hear a lot of input on that but we're still in the what you might call the consumer spending transformation that in Covid services went down, which normally doesn't happen in a recession because people couldn't go to the dentist and people couldn't go to the movies or see sports and they shifted to buying physical goods.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-102" data-timestamp="11:06" class="neutral">So the share of their budget that they spent on manufactured goods went way up and we're shifting back.</span> <span id="sentence-103" data-timestamp="11:13" class="neutral">You're seeing that shift back.</span> <span id="sentence-104" data-timestamp="11:15" class="neutral">So that's playing out in manufacturing, too.</span> <span id="sentence-105" data-timestamp="11:19" class="neutral">Very quick last question or two questions you can answer yes or no.</span> <span id="sentence-106" data-timestamp="11:23" class="neutral">The things people wanted me to ask you, was there any talk at the meeting of raising rates or about raising rates?</span> <span id="sentence-107" data-timestamp="11:30" class="neutral">And did you have an advanced look at the jobs numbers?</span> <span id="sentence-108" data-timestamp="11:33" class="neutral">Okay.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-109" data-timestamp="11:35" class="neutral">You don't have an advance.</span> <span id="sentence-110" data-timestamp="11:36" class="neutral">Look at the jobs numbers.</span> <span id="sentence-111" data-timestamp="11:38" class="neutral">You're going to have to wait five years to get the transcript from the meetings.</span> <span id="sentence-112" data-timestamp="11:42" class="neutral">The minutes will come out in a few weeks.</span> <span id="sentence-113" data-timestamp="11:44" class="neutral">So I'm definitely not going to say what people talk about.</span> <span id="sentence-114" data-timestamp="11:49" class="neutral">I as you know, I never put anything on the table or off the table.</span></p>

<p><span id="sentence-115" data-timestamp="11:55" class="neutral">I try to be as paranoid as possible about all potentialities and what could happen.</span></p>
