## Transcript:
- [00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmfIeGtL1w&t=50s) good morning I'm David wessell director of the hutchon center on fiscal and monetary policy at the Brookings institution I'm very pleased today to welcome fed Governor Christopher w to our virtual stage uh for those of you who aren't in Washington uh we've had our first significant snowfall in two years and even though where Governor Waller comes from in Minnesota this would be a normal day in Washington the city's paralyzed but we had a lot of practice at uh virtual events during Co and I'm very pleased that we've been
- [01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmfIeGtL1w&t=80s) able to do this one today uh Governor Waller was named to the Federal Reserve board by President Trump and he served since uh the end of 2020 he took that post after uh 11 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis where he was the research director I'm going to turn the podium over to Governor Waller who has some remarks to make and then he'll join me afterwards for a conversation so welcome Governor Waller well thank you David and thank you to Brookings for the opportunity to speak to you today in the second half of
- [01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmfIeGtL1w&t=115s) 2023 I gave a series of speeches about the apparent conflict between the strength of economic activity in the third quarter and continued progress toward the Federal Open Market committee's 2% inflation goal I said then that something's got to give either activity needs to moderate or progress on lowering inflation is going to stop by late November the latest economic data left me encouraged that there were signs excuse me that there were signs of moderating econom IC activity in the fourth quarter but inflation was still too high as of
- [02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=154s) today the data has come in even better Real gross domestic product is expected to have grown between 1 and 2% in the fourth quarter unemployment is still below 4% and core personal consumption expenditure inflation or pce inflation has been running close to 2% for the last six months for a macroeconomist this is almost as good as it gets but will it last time will tell whether inflation can can be sustained on its recent path and allow us to conclude that we have achieved the FC's price stability goal time will tell if this
- [03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=190s) will happen while the labor market still performs above expectations the data we have received in the last few months is allowing the committee to consider cutting the policy rate in 2024 however concerns about the sustainability of these data Trends requires changes in the path of policy to be carefully calibrated and not rushed in the end I'm feeling more confident that the economy can continue along its current trajectory let me start with the data on economic activity that has brought me to this View and then I'll talk about the
- [03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=228s) labor market Financial conditions and inflation I'll conclude with what I think the implications are from all that for monetary policy now first economic activity has moderated after averaging an annualized 3% over the first three quarters of 2023 and 5% in the third quarter growth in Real GDP appears to have slowed appreciably in the fourth quarter the average of private sector forecast summarized by the Blue Chip survey estimates that estimates that real GDP grew 1 and a half% in the final three months of
- [04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=266s) 2023 the Atlanta fed's GDP now model Based on data in hand currently stands at 2.2% an important part of that moderation comes from business investment and government spending both of which slow showed rapid growth earlier in 2023 that didn't appear sustainable consumer spending also accounted for much of the surprising strength in GDP growth earlier in the year but here the Slowdown so far appears more tentative factors such as high interest rates a depletion of excess saving and a pickup in credit card usage all portend
- [05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=306s) slower growth ahead but it is unclear how much of that slowing has already occurred since consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP this component of demand is obviously critical for the Outlook we'll find out more about consumer spending tomorrow from the report on December's retail sales turning to the labor market over the course of 2023 there have been increases in labor Supply amid slowing demand for labor and I expect this to continue to bring the labor market into better balance some have seen the latest jobs
- [05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=342s) report as in conflict with this story so let me explain why I don't see it that way the short vision is that I see surprises than the December jobs report as largely noise against a trend of ongoing moderation that supports progress towards 2% inflation the unemployment rate in December held steady at 3.
- [06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=364s) 7% while employers added 216,000 jobs which was more than expected and an increase from 173,000 created in November and 105,000 created in October well that looks like a modest acceleration in job creation I remind myself that revisions to monthly payrolls have been downward for most of 2023 from the first to third estimate employ gains were revised down in nine of the last 10 job reports given this recent history of revisions there's a good chance that December will be revised down as well Furthermore with growth
- [06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=404s) expectations moderating overcoming quarters employment gains are likely to slow we can see that this is already happening if we look at progress over the previous quarters average monthly payroll gains over the fourth quarter were 165,000 a step down from the 221,000 average in the third quarter and 257,000 in the first half of 2023 so this data shows an improving balance between labor supply and demand likewise an uptick and wage growth last month should be viewed over a longer time Horizon average hourly earnings Rose 0.4% in December as they
- [07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=445s) did in November and the three and 12 month increases ticked up but over the course of the fourth quarter wages Rose less than they did in the third quarter and over the past several quarters I see a moderation and wage increases across various measures of Labor compensation that I expect will be consistent with ongoing progress toward 2% inflation and though there was a drop in labor force participation in December the fourth quarter average is higher than it was in 2022 these are all signs that the labor market Contin continues to come into
- [08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=480s) better balance meanwhile data on job openings indicates ongoing moderation in labor demand now job openings played a prominent role in my thinking over the last two years about how restrictive monetary policy aimed at bringing down inflation will Impact labor demand and unemployment now one can think of total labor demand as being the sum of the workers currently employed and the number of workers that firms want a hire the latter is best measured by posted job vacancies if labor demand declines the question is will employment bear the
- [08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=520s) brunt of the reduction in demand or will vacancies absorb the impact traditional Phillips curve analysis assumes that employment would bear the brunt and as a result unemployment would rise significantly from a tightening of monetary policy history has shown that this is not an unreasonable assumption particularly when the job vacancy rate is below 4 a half% but in the spring of 2022 the vacancy rate peaked around 7.
- [09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=552s) 5% with nearly 12 million job vacancies and there were still about six million unemployed workers it just seemed counterintuitive to me that with that many job openings and so few people looking for work that the first thing a firm would do when labor demand soften would be to lay off workers my economic Instinct was at this time things would be different and that vacancies would absorb the decline in labor demand while employment and unemployment change very relatively little but Instinct isn't enough sometimes one needs an economic model to
- [09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=587s) verify your instinct and good data analysis is needed to quantify the theoretical impact this is what I provided in a speech I gave in May of 2022 with the help of Andrew fera in that speech we described a textbook labor search model to derive a beverage curve which is a theoretical relationship between job vacancies and the unemployment rate to quantify the effects of restrictive monetary policy unemployment we use standard empirical methods to calibrate the theoretical model we show that if restrictive monetary policy could lower the vacancy
- [10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=624s) rate from 7 and a half to 4.5% Via sign ific decline in job vacancies there would be relatively small increase in the unemployment rate from 3.7% to 4.2% So based on this analysis we argued that as long as the involuntary job separation rate did not rise restrictive monetary policy would allow the f1c to bring inflation down without a significant increase in the unemployment rate this seemed like a very plausible assumption given the incredibly High vacancy rate and and Darth of workers looking for jobs now our predictions
- [11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=663s) contract contradicted standard Philips curve analysis and historical precedent but we were in unprecedented times in 2022 it's been nearly two years since I gave that speech how is our prediction fared data receives since then have supported our argument since March of 2022 the fomc raised the policy rate over 500 basis points and core inflation core PC inflation has fallen substantially especially when measured over the last 6 months during this dramatic tightening of policy the job vacancy rate fell from around
- [11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=701s) 7.5% to 5.2% which brought the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people to a touch below 1.4 down from the peak of two and not far from the pre-pandemic level of 1.2 the involuntary job separation rate has has remained essentially unchanged at 1% since April 2022 meanwhile the unemployment rate while bouncing around a bit is the same as it was in March of 2022 3.
- [12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=736s) 7% which is even lower than we predicted now we argued this couldn't go on forever we showed in our research that if the vacancy rate continued to fall below 4 and a half% there would be a significant increase in the unemployment rate so from now on the setting of policy needs to proceed with more caution to avoid overtightening but to me this episode shows that good theory combined with good data analysis can lead to good policy outcomes even if the predictions te challenge conventional wisdom moving on from the labor market another important factor affecting
- [12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=773s) economic activity and progress towards e fomc's economic objectives is financial conditions and I wanted to give my view of where they stand there has been a lot of focus on tightening Financial conditions in the fall and then easing of those conditions more recently my view continues to be that onnet Financial conditions remain restricted and continue to have the desired effect of being a drag on economic activity to put downward pressure on inflation now recall that the 10year treasury yield peaked in mid October
- [13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=807s) around 5% at the time of the dump up in measured economic activity in the third quarter and shortly after a very strong jobs report for September at that point fomc participants still expected another rate hike in 2023 but then the data started cooling off the FC's December summary of economic projections indicated no more hikes and the 10year treasury yield fell to around 4% which is roughly where it was just after the fomc's last rate height in July and remember that in July the widespread view was the financial conditions were
- [14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=843s) pretty tight so I consider this to still be true today and that judgment is supported by current readings of financial conditions indices which capture a broader set of financial variable so let's talk about what the data on economic activity the labor market and financial conditions mean for progress towards 2% inflation the backdrop is that we made a lot of progress on inflation in 2023 the 12-month percent change in total pce inflation the fomc's preferred measure for our Target fell from 5.3% in January
- [14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=879s) to 2.6% in November the latest month of data factoring out volatile energy and food prices core inflation is a better guide to where inflation is going and core pce inflation fell from 5% in January to 3.2% in November with inflation declining over the course of the year I like to look at three and six-month measures to have a better understanding of the current level of inflation as I noted earlier six-month change in core inflation has been hovering close to a 2% annual rate as has the three-month measure data on inflation for December
- [15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=920s) was released last week for the CPI and producer price index CPI inflation for both Total and core Rose 0.3% for the month producer price index or PPI inflation numbers reported a continued decline in those prices some of the PPI data Fade Into December PC inflation and private sector forecast suggest that the monthly core pce reading will be again around 0.
- [15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=953s) 2% if those forecasts hold true then core PC inflation in December will remain close to 2% when measured on a three or six month basis now pce inflation of 2% is our goal but that goal cannot be achieved for just a moment in time it must be sustained at a level of 2% as I said earlier based on economic activity and the cooling of the labor market I am becoming more confident that we are within Striking Distance of achieving a sustainable level of 2% PC inflation I think we are close but I will need more inflation in the coming months confirming or conceivably
- [16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=993s) challenging the notion that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our inflation goal so this brings me to the implications for monetary policy the progress I have noted on inflation combined with the data in hand on economic and financial conditions and my Outlook has made me more confident than I have been since 2021 that inflation is on a path to 2% while the emphasis of policy since that time has been on pushing down inflation given the current strength of the labor market the FC's Focus now is likely to be more balanced keeping
- [17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1030s) inflation on a 2% path while also keeping employment near its maximal level today I view the risk to our employment and inflation mandates as being closely balanced I will be watching for sustained progress on inflation and modest Cooling in the labor market that doesn't harm the economy I believe policy is set properly it is restrictive and should continue to put downward pressure on demand to allow us to continue to see moderate inflation ratings so as I said I believe we're on the right track to achieve 2%
- [17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1067s) inflation as long as inflation doesn't rebound and stay elevated I believe the FMC will be able to lower the target range for the F federal funds rate this year this view is consistent consistent with the FC's economic projections in December in which the median projection was for three 25 basis point Cuts in 2024 now clearly the timing of cuts and the actual number of cuts in 24 will depend on the incoming data risk that would delay or dampen my expectation for cuts this year or that the E are that
- [18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1102s) economic activity that seems to have moderated in the fourth quarter of 2023 does not play out what the balance of supply and demand in the labor market which improved over 2023 stops improving or reverses and that the gains on moderating inflation evaporate one piece of data I will be watching closely is the scheduled revisions to CPI inflation due next month recall that a year ago when it looked like inflation was coming down quickly the annual update to the seasonal factors erased those gains in mid-February we will get the January CPI
- [19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1141s) report and revisions for 2023 potentially changing the picture on inflation My Hope Is that revisions confirm the progress we have seen but good policy is based on data and not on hope when the time is right to begin lowering rates I believe it can and should be lowered methodically and carefully in many previous Cycles which began after shocks of the economy either threatened or caused a recession the fomc cut rates reactively and did so quickly and often by large amounts this cycle however with economic activity and labor markets in good shape
- [19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1188s) and inflation coming down gradually to 2% I see no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past the healthy state of the economy provides the flexibility to lower the nominal policy rate to keep the real policy rate an appropriate level of tightness but I will end by repeating that the timing and number of rate Cuts will be driven by the incoming data thank you thank you Governor wall uh Governor Waller uh let me pick up where you left off uh you said that you've basically described a soft Landing scenario so
- [20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1229s) congratulations on that if you can pull it off um we have a Fed funds rate that's between 5 and a qu and five and a half percent and as you point out inflation is approaching your 2% goal so why move slowly and gradually why talk about three quarter point moves on the FED funds rate won't that leave Financial conditions restrictive and risk the overtightening that you warned against well as I said the key thing is the economy is doing well it's giving us the flexibility to move carefully and methodically so we can kind of watch the
- [21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1272s) FED see how the data comes in see if progress is being sustained I mean the worst thing we'd have is it all reverses and we've already studed starting to cut so we really want to see evidence that this progress this trend we're seeing in the real data and the inflation data continues I believe it will we have to see that before we can start making decisions and as I said we can slowly calibrate the real rate cut down uh if we think we need to move it faster we could move it faster depending on what
- [21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1301s) the data says but the key is we have the flexibility that we can be methodical and careful that's where my point was in earlier times a recession would hit some bad negative shock and the emsy had to move fast and by a lot that's not the situation we're facing right now so we can can take our time to make sure we do this right and how will you decide when it's time to pull the trigger on the First Rate cut what are you thinking well that'll be up to the committee to decide when they think
- [22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1330s) they've seen enough progress and there may be disagreements about whether we need more we've seen enough but that's where the committee will talk about this as we go forward um so you know I'll just leave it at that I see I see so um let me ask you a little bit about the the relative merits of cutting early but gradually versus waiting longer and cutting more quickly you make the point that you don't want to go too soon because inflation might turn out to be more varent but isn't there a risk if you go
- [22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1363s) too slowly given the lags of monetary policy uh that we could end up overtightening and how do you guard against that well that is one of the risks that I've mentioned I think we're all very aware of it Cher Paul even talked about that at his press conference in December that we're in this unusual place where we can actually lower the policy rate not because there's a shock of the economy in a recession but we can sort of bring it down to keep the real policy rate at the right level of tightness to
- [23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1392s) maintain our inflation goals but not damage the economy in any serious way so I I wouldn't want to start until we were thoroughly we were all relatively convinced that inflation was sustainably near our 2% Target it'll bounce around with any monthly data we have to be ready for that and look through some of that when we think we're there and it'll stay there then we can start saying okay it's time one time to cut and then we can start thinking how fast do we want to cut or how often what
- [23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1423s) the pace is or how big that cuts those are all things we can determine once we decide to move there's no real radical uh reason that we have to bring the real policy rate down from like 3% to 50 basis points points in one meeting that we don't have to do that we can take our time and and see how that all works um one of the issues when you look at the underlying inflation data is that rents have been pretty sticky stickier than a lot of us anticipated do you think you need to see rents come down the Housing Shelter
- [24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1458s) index come down or is there a risk that you or can you not can you look through that and say it's going to come down we don't need to wait to see that materialize yeah I mean we've been talking about this since the end of 2022 that rent inflation for all the signals we were given rent inflation was going to come down it's just taking a while to show up in the official CPI data for exactly the reasons we all know things tend to reset every 12 months you have to wait till this all kind of works its
- [24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1488s) way through but most of the data we're seeing on new leases uh our showing rents have come down quite a bit or down now in more reasonable rate you know in increases so we all think it's all going to be there but at the end of the day I have never been a big fan of focusing on one component of of the price index you know one time one's up then this one's down it's just we take them all together food and energy are the only ones I kind of like to toss out because they're not necessarily good
- [25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1517s) guides but I don't want I don't like getting into used cars or rents we can look at them and say you know but when we add them all up that's what matters so I don't want to get overly focused on one particular price and say until I see that one coming down we can't do anything but it sounds to me like you're it sounds to me like your best forecast given the available data is that inflation has come down it's not just some transitory fluke and that you'd be surprised if inflation reared its ugly
- [25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1549s) head you think we're going in the right direction am I reading you correctly I think so I mean one of the you know one of the concerns we have there's been a lot of talk that a lot of of the drop in inflation over the last six months has all been supply side Corrections well once those things correct that that those Tailwinds are gone so that'll tell us something about whether demand is still low you know it's being lowered enough to kind of keep inflation on that path or once Goods prices other things
- [26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1579s) bottom out whether we'll see a rebound above 2% in a meaningful and sustained way that's what those are the kind of things we want to be careful about before think about making the First Rate cut so it sounds like you'd rather air on the side of waiting too long than going too soon yeah what too long means is that one meeting is that six I I don't know what waiting too long me but you know in the grand scheme of things whether it's one six weeks later that's kind of it's kind of hard
- [26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1610s) to believe that's gonna have a huge impact on the state of the economy so let me ask you a little bit about the balance sheet reserves are now at $3.5 trillion the overnight reverse repurchase facility has gone from well over 2 trillion to about 600 billion how are you thinking about the balance sheet how will you decide when you've reached that Nirvana of ample reserves and how close are we to that yeah so starting back in 2021 I was watching what was happening at the enrp and in what I was arguing at the
- [27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1645s) time was that we were doing QE we're putting Reserve in the system the banks for leverage reasons didn't want this on their balance sheet told their corporate customers get it out of our banks they had to put it somewhere they go to money market mutual funds who say what are we supposed to do with it there's a shortage of treasury bills oh there's the enrp let's give it right back to the FED that got up to$ two trillion dollar a little over two trillion so I interpret that as that's two trillion
- [27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1672s) dollars worth of liquidity in the system that nobody needs or wants so logic to me seem we could pulled at least two trillion out before we had to get serious about worrying about the level of reserves and so far we've pulled out somewhere in the neighborhood of I think one and a half one I don't know the exact number but one and a half trillion dollars and everything's fine so that kind of perspective seems again to be borne out where we actually end up I've made this argument many times now but given
- [28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1703s) the pace if you look back to January 2019 reserves there was no RRP but reserves to uh nominal GDP was about 8% now banks are bigger there may be some other reasons you might want slightly more but figure maybe 10 to 11% would be a reasonable number so as the RRP starts draining and we can start looking at reserves we'll start slowing down and start approaching these numbers with a lot more caution to see how how things play out we'll get a better sense of where that is but I've been kind of using this number say roughly 10 to 11%
- [28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1736s) of GDP as as an approximate end point for um draining reserves out of the system so do you expect thep are do you expect the on RRP to basically go to zero and then you'll know that that's there's no reason for it to have anything in it in in my view it was basically a safety net originally designed to help put a floor under the FED funds rate because of this weirdness the last two years between treasury bill rates and our RRP rate everybody just Park money there instead there's nothing fundamental about money being in that
- [29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1771s) facility that it matters so we really prefer to have anything in the banking system in reserves as long as there aren't problems with leverage uh ratios or anything else for the banks but we can then see how the draining of the reserves kind of works and we'll be careful about how we do all that so do you expect to slow the pace of tapering in the next few months I would say sometime this year it would be a reasonable thing to start thinking about it I mean I don't I I I don't think I'm speaking out of school but uh I mean
- [30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1801s) it's been two it's been coming close to two years since we first announce tapering and I think when we did these numbers that it made sense that sometime in 24 you would start thinking about tapering the pace to get back now personally I don't think we need to taper the pace on MBS we're not even hitting the cap so we don't really I personally don't really want to keep MBS on my balance sheet as much so I'm all in favor of letting es going to just continue to run off at the current Pace
- [30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1831s) but but treasuries we can start tapering that back and get uh Reserve to where we want them one other point to make now everybody likes to go back to 209 September 2019 and say all of a sudden you didn't have enough reserves and there's a bunch of curf fluffle in the financial markets we have a standing repo facility now that we didn't have in place so if we start seeing reserves getting Tighter and Tighter we may start seeing a lot of activity coming to the standing repo facility and that'll be a
- [30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1859s) good signal for us that hey we're getting to that point so again that's a tool we didn't have back in 2019 that we do to help relieve kind of pressure on demand for reserves right so just to explain that to people who may not be familiar with the uh explosion of facilities under your leadership at the at the board you're complient in this so basically if the banks don't have if the banks are worried that they don't have enough Reserves they can take their treasuries and bring them to the FED at
- [31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1890s) the standing repo facility and get something which is essentially cash substitute do one of the things I've wondered about is that on one hand there seems to be a sense among many monetary policy policy makers that we don't want the fed's balance sheet to be too big we don't want the FED to be too big a force in the economy that's what leads you to to begin to do quantitative tightening on the other hand uh we've put demands on the banks to hold more reserves with these liquidity rules and this sort of
- [32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1926s) uh worry that we know how do we protect ourselves against instability how do you balance those and aren't those somewhat attention those two goals yeah I mean I've I've made an argument for probably 10 years there's no economic theory that tells you how big a central bank's balance sheet should be I know of no theory that tells you uh you have Switzerland where you know it's basically 100% of GDP or some number like that so there's no there's no real Theory I mean and and from a
- [32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1955s) point of view of the reserves I love a floor system because as Milton Freedman once said you know you want to put enough liquidity in the system that you satiate the system so there's no scarcity or shortage and I always like to use a little example you know if you were the government you could provide clear clean clear drinking water at zero marginal cost why would you make it scarce you wouldn't you'd put in whatever the market needs and and that and it it's just really we're putting in reserves
- [33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=1983s) taking treasuries it's not like we're taking out commercial loans or car loans or anything we're just taking treasuries and there's a lot of Treasury issuance so it's not like there's a shortage of treasuries in the world per se but that's kind of how I look at it there's no real theory about it we need to put it in I love to follow the Freedman Rule and make reserves abundant enough that there's no scarcity the banks and the system have what they need that's just good economic
- [33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2011s) efficiency so why struggle to get to ample why not just stick with abundant reserves you could I mean I had a paper a few years ago where I looked at a floor system and the problem with the large balance sheet is kind of what we're running into now you potentially have a situation where your payments on interest on reserves is above your earnings now there's nothing that affects our operating and monetary policy whatsoever but the Optics and I at the title of the paper I had was some unpleasant fysical
- [34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2042s) arithmetic the Optics of this are are just bad it doesn't it has nothing to do with monetary policy at all effective is nothing but it just kind of looks bad that you're not turning over any seniorage revenues to the treasury and you're delaying when you'll start doing it and for that reason you may want to think about not keeping your balance sheet too big that but that's really you know that's one of the few reasons for doing it there's a misperception that we're again we're taking real resources
- [34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2071s) out of the economy for Lending by Banks and car loans and construction that none of that's going on we're just taking out treasuries uh Governor Waller uh you voted against the recent proposal to increase the capital that big banks are required to set aside uh there's been a lot of criticism of that uh and lots of comments and and I think you've indicated that you're hoping that there will be a compromise that you can support so where are we in that process do you think we're getting to a bank
- [35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2105s) Capital Proposal with which you're comfortable well yeah I voted not to put this out because I saw what I thought were some very major problems uh first of all the original intent of this thing was to harmonize regulation across the world and it was not happening European Banks UK Banks were not going to carry through we decided to go ahead that's not Harmon anything the original intent I believe was not to have a big increase in capital but that is what's happening we're basically go to impinge on Capital
- [35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2137s) Market functioning both in terms of products Services pricing I don't understand why we want to do that in a way that it's not seriously showing any threats I've made a big deal about operational risk which is more than half of the increase and the way it's calculated me absolutely no sense to me whatsoever it should be restricted so there's lots of reasons why I uh was opposed to it and voted not to send this thing out and I think the blowback we've seen from the banking industry and the
- [36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2165s) hill has shown that this is not necessarily A good rule proposed rule as it stands now so it's got to have a major overhaul in my view to get a reasonable product and you know possibly even just taking it back and starting over but I believe there's a lot of work that could be done we're a very con fed uh J has said we want to have products to go out with broad support of the board that may be possible if enough major things get redone that we could get a broad support for it but it's got to have a lot of work and like I said it
- [36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2202s) might even be best to just pull it back and then work on this and then put it back out at a later date so where are we in the process are you talking about changes that might make it Poss if you to support it I believe there's discussions going on we're taking feedback from the industry today I think is a closing on a comment period on the proposed rul making we'll take all that into account we're talking to other agencies we're talking among ourselves here at the board about how could we do
- [37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2229s) something so there is stuff going on it is working and we we'll see in the end what ends up happening another regulatory issue that I was asked uh to raise with you is the reg II the where the FED has proposed reducing the amount the the cut uh that it's taken when someone uses a debit card and of course the merchants love this they want a smaller cut and the banks say oh it's going to be a problem have you thought about that and where do you stand on that one yeah I mean this is one of those things you know I I wish Congress had
- [37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2263s) never given us the responsibility for doing we did so you know with anything that's now our job uh I take a very narrow legalistic view Congress told us to set this interchange fee based on on the cost of these transactions we had a method we did when we first did it we hadn't changed it in roughly almost 14 years even though there's been a tremendous technological change over the last decade and so there was a decision to look at it collect data from the banks get a sense of where their true costs are and then based on the same
- [38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2304s) methodology the same approach the same criteria that we did before pick that number and put it out there and that's what we did I mean I don't want to pick winners and losers there's no fun in having to do any of that but Congress told us to do it and we kind of just did it again uh like we did roughly 14 years whatever the exact number of years was so I just try to keep a very focused narrow legal view that Congress did and we're following that to the to the team um a couple of questions have come
- [38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2337s) in while we've been talking one of them which is a good one I should have thought of is to what extent do you think that the crisis in the Red Sea the shipping costs and rate going up could be a problem in controlling inflation how big a risk is that to the Outlook you know that there are alternative routes to routing stuff you doesn't have to go through the Red Sea so you know now you're just talking about substitution about where you going to go and how you going to do it uh so in that sense there could be some
- [39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2366s) onetime effects and shipping raides that get passed through but I don't see it potentially being a big big impact on certain Global or US inflation unless this thing you know spirals into something much more severe than it appears that it is right now another question was what your view is about what role that fiscal policy played in causing the inflation that you've been working so hard to restrain how big an issue was fiscal policy and how big an issue is fiscal policy now as you try and calibrate the right pace of
- [40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2402s) monetary easing well just from a it's just a simple macroeconomics point of view if you're going to increase the spending in the debt by six trillion dollars in a matter of two years and then say that has no effect on demand that seems just impossible to me it isn't the only thing that contributed to the inflation but it certainly had T to have had an impact the reason I say that is you know people have been talking a lot about oh all the last six months shows this was all supply all supply all Supply well if these are
- [40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2438s) temporary Supply shocks when they unwind the price level should go back down to where it was it's not go go to Fred pull up CPI take the log look at that thing the level of inflation is permanently higher that doesn't happen with Supply shocks that comes from demand and this was a permanent increase in demand permanent increase in debt so I think there clearly was an effect a permanent increase in the price level you mean not in the pace of inflation yes yes yes price level right think go up and then
- [41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2469s) come back down do you think that fiscal policies continuing to put upward pressure on prices now I you know when it comes to fiscal policy our kind of rules always been we don't you know Congress does what it wants and then we take that as given and set policy so that's it that's all I do so it's up to Congress decide what they want to do and then I'll no but I I I take that but taking fiscal policy as given now do you feel that that's putting upward pressure on demand and making it harder for you
- [41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2499s) to keep inflation from rising well most of the spending the last fiscal policy the last like year or so has been more on longer term right you know investment manufacturing you know renewable energy all that stuff those things are more spread out over a decade so yeah there's going to be some impact but it's probably not that big particularly for Consumer retail goods and things like that that's not what any of the spending the last years has been right you might say the fiscal spending was transitory
- [42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2530s) if that's a word you're allowed to use yeah again these are Level effects these are not permanent changes in Trend inflation they they might have had some but again the IRA and all these things are stretched out over 10 years of spending so any given a small impact let me ask you to elaborate a little more on the comments you made about wages you said that um wages you see a moderation of wage increases ac across various measures of Labor compensation that you expect will be consistent with progress
- [42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2562s) towards 2% inflation so um are do do the pace of wage increases have to slow in order for you to reach your goal or is this a period of catchup or what how do we know what wages increases are consistent with 2% inflation well standard economic answer you'd come out of of from theory is nominal wage growth should be equal to productivity growth plus expected inflation that would be the nominal wage growth so if inflation's 2% productivity growth which has averaged basically 1 and a half% for the last 15 plus years
- [43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2599s) you're at three and a half% nominal rage goal so when we often say wage growth needs to be consistent with our goal we mean also that's consistent with productivity so at 4% you're a little high but you're not that high so You' you can come down but it's not like when it's seven or eight% in productivity is one and a half percent and right now we're a little boom in in productivity which also could support it for a while temporarily we'll see whether that productivity boom continues I sure hope
- [43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2629s) it does but you know if you look back over the last P since the pandemic started productivity growths been one and a half half percent just exactly what it was in previous decade so we'll have to see a lot more before but that's kind of the rule of thumb I think most economists have for what nominal wage growth should be productivity growth plus expected inflation so recognizing that predicting productivity growth into the future is difficult uh are are you optimistic that whatever's going on whether it's more efficiency in the
- [44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2659s) economy or a or something will allow us to enjoy somewhat faster pace of productivity growth over the next several years yeah I mean we really would love to see product that's that productivity growth is the heart and soul of raising living standards for people over decade that is what does it now back in the 90s we had a big productivity boom but we all knew it was because you finally Incorporated computers PCS everything into the system when I look out right now and think what would it be that's causing this big boom
- [44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2690s) in productivity to be sustained it can't be AI that just that just started usually usually these Innovations take a decade to filter all through the entire economy before they show up um now maybe there's ways that firms have done stuff coming out of the pandemic that are still being used that are efficient just the way we're doing the speech this would not have been done prior prior to 2020 restaurant Services manufacturing everybody figured this out the shortage of Labor firms had to think about other
- [45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2721s) ways with capital to produce they're not going to unwind any of that once they do it so there could be some things that lead to you know sustained productivity growth for a while but I you know other than that I don't really see exactly what it would be AI could be very promising but it's it's really to show up in the aggregate data that's down the road one thing that a lot of economists have focused on a lot is the long run equilibrium interest rate so-called rstar and the view is that if you could
- [45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2752s) discern our star you know that what if the FED funds rate is above that that's restrictive and vice versa if it's below that a do you find that a useful concept and B do you have any sense of where whether we're going to go back to a low our star world yeah I mean I think it is a useful concept because if we think about simple things like tail rules there's some equilibrium real rate pick your you know so you know where your terminal you know your neutral policy rate is you got to have some estimate of
- [46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2780s) what this real rate is the real rate you want to think about is something that's a close substitute for reserves or which is what the rate we control that has to be some very safe liquid government debt instrument it is not physical capital it is not equities the rate of return on fiscal capital for the last 40 years has been roughly 7% and it doesn't move there's some good academic work out there that has shown this what you've seen is the real return on safe liquid government debt declined for 40
- [46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2811s) years from about 4% down to roughly a half a percent to zero so there's something special about you know government debt and that has driven this sort of long run Decline and there could be lots of and I've talked about imp there could be lots of factors that cause that could explain that decline but then you have to think what is it that suddenly is going to cause it to reverse and go up if it's demographics why is demographics going to suddenly change now productivity if it's productivity it's got to affect a real
- [47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2842s) return in capital it can't just affect RAR and we're not seeing that you know any moving those things together uh one thing is just you know potentially there is a I have kind of argued for a long time I think there has been sort of a shortage of safe liquid government debt in the in the world a shortage of safe assets and that would drive up the price and drive down the yield of those assets but for that to happen the trend growth of demand has to outpace the trend growth of Supply to keep that real rate
- [47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2871s) going down if that reverses you could suddenly see our start to go up so that's why I think I have and some other people been concerned that the outlook for fiscal policy whatever it is it could have the implication if it starts Rising faster than the demand for these products you might see some uh inop drop in the price and increase in the real return on these assets to me that's one thing that could happen and how do you just you find this a useful guide to think about where you want R to go or not I do I mean you have to kind of
- [48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2905s) figure out some I mean you need to kind of you know unless you just want to do what are called like first difference rules and tailor rules where you don't need to think about this thing and you just say hey the economy looks like we're at Target just whatever rate you're at just stop there I mean that that's one that you know there's some argument for that we don't really know so just when the economy looks stable at 2% 2% growth unemployment or four four five whatever whatever that interest rate is just stop
- [48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2936s) there that's that's your neutral history so let me close on this um as I said earlier you joined the Federal Reserve Board in December 2020 we were in the the the throws of the pandemic uh we it's been an extraordinarily interesting period in Economic Policy huge response to a pandemic the vaccines came online lots of fiscal stimulus lots of monetary uh stimulus we enjoyed a very quick recovery quicker than a lot of us expected um as you pointed out in your speech we were thinking about the relationship between unemployment and
- [49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=2974s) inflation maybe differently when you look back at what we've learned over the last two or three years about how the economy functions what are the things that stand out to you that we really need to be thinking hard about that maybe history wasn't the best guide yeah so I think this issue about vacancies and unemployment or labor market tightness as it's called in labor search models that was never built in really in Philips curve analysis in the past but now everything I see more recent academic work more policy analysis best
- [50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=3007s) measure of Labor Market tightness is not just the unemployment rate right it's a vacancy to the unemployment rate that that really is has got to be the case and I think that's a step forward and thinking look we got to think about a more broader more accurate measur than just the trid and C Philips curve it's not that it's potentially wrong I've never been a big fan of it but at least people are thinking about how to think about what happened in the last two years and how do we think about policy
- [50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=3034s) going forward with the right kind of analytical tools to do that so I think that's that that's been very good I think just you know the robustness in which the US came back and you know there's been some debates about the difference between Europe and the US uh I was just in Europe out of some meetings last week and this came up that you know Europe is flat their GDP has not come back it basically got back and then it's just completely flattened out it hasn't gone on stayed on Trend and so
- [51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=3064s) there's a lot of discussion about why is the US recovered so well and Europe has not maybe it's the policies that were done during the pandemic in terms of in Europe they protected the workers on the job and we just basically said we'll just give you unemployment insurance and firms just let people go people quit and then there was a matching maybe that had some some advantages that we just aren't seeing in Europe where nobody left their firm they stayed there they got paid by the government but there was no resorting or
- [51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=3098s) reallocation of Labor so may maybe there's something to be learned from there from an academic point of view the other thing learn is inflation isn't dead for 40 years people or 30 years people thought yeah when inflation there's no such thing as inflation we don't even need to worry about it well we do and that is what you know we have to you know we can't go to sleep on that it's our job to make sure that that stays at 2% and that's it so how does that no it's great I appreciate your cander how how does that
- [52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=3129s) inform your thinking about the framework the FED monetary policy framework which you'll be beginning to revisit at the end of this year yeah I mean I think there's some good lessons learned about what we saw I mean I think the old framework was really backward looking in the sense it was like trying to solve the problems from the previous de decade that we thought were going to continue and then we got punched in the face with you know what happened after 2020 so it is going to lead us to think about what is the
- [52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=3160s) right framework for how we do it now we have to have we have a dual mandate so it's not it isn't going to be ah we're gonna ignore employment and just focus on price stability that's not going to happen so those kind of things are not going to be seriously considered but there'll probably be a lot of discussion of in terms of you know what kind of framework how do we want to think about operating procedure how worried are we about the lower zero lower bound going forward which was our Nemesis for a
- [53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=3185s) decade um so there'll be a lot of discussion and we'll look for input from the general public Academia policy world just like we did last time great well with that uh thank you very much for your time and let me add my thanks to the uh AV and Communications team at Brookings for allowing us to do this even though Washington is paralyzed by 4 Ines of snow uh and appreciate your time and your very uh crisp answers to the questions all right thank you everyone I appreciate it especially again the AV staff for pulling this together at the
- [53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undefined&t=3220s) last minute
