<span id="sentence-22" data-timestamp="24:06">Kai: 45 minutes, so I'm going to jump right in with the data of the morning. PCE came out this morning, you had it yesterday. 2.8% at the core. Here's my question - you saw it yesterday, what was your first thought?</span>

<span id="sentence-23" data-timestamp="24:36">Powell: My first thought was that the report that came out this morning is pretty much in line with our expectations. So core PCE, as you mentioned, is at 2.8% on a 12-month basis. Headline is at 2.5%. That's what we were expecting, and it's good to see something coming in in line with expectations.</span>

<span id="sentence-24" data-timestamp="25:13">Kai: So as you and your colleagues at the Fed and at the regional banks have been saying, we want more data, more good data. Is this in that bucket?</span>

<span id="sentence-25" data-timestamp="25:13">Powell: Well, let's take a step back. Over the course of the second half of last year, we got what I would definitely consider good data. Over the course of seven months, and then in January of this year, we got a very high reading, much higher reading on inflation. And so February is lower, but it's not as low as most of the good readings we got in the second half of last year. But it's definitely more along the lines of what we want to see.</span>

<span id="sentence-26" data-timestamp="25:43">What we said is that we don't see it as likely to be appropriate that we would begin to reduce interest rates until the committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, is confident that inflation is moving down to 2% on a sustained basis. And what do we need to get that confidence? It's just more good inflation readings like the ones we were getting last year.</span>

<span id="sentence-27" data-timestamp="25:43">Kai: With all possible respect, you all have been saying the same thing for now six months, right? We want more good data. What do you suppose it does to the listening public and to the professionals who are listening to this when you keep saying the same thing?</span>

<span id="sentence-28" data-timestamp="26:14">Powell: So we're steady, our hand is a steady hand in this. We've been saying all through last year and this year that we're making progress. We've noted that progress, we haven't overreacted to it. We didn't overreact to the good data we had in the second half of last year. You heard us saying that this is good, but we need to see more.</span>

<span id="sentence-29" data-timestamp="26:41">And you won't hear us overreacting to these two months that are higher. The reason that's important is that the decision to begin to reduce rates is a very, very important one, because the risks are two-sided. If we reduce rates too soon, there's a chance that inflation would pop back up and we'd have to come back in, and that would be very disruptive, that would not be a good thing for the economy. There's also a risk that we would wait too long, and that that would, you know, in that case it could be unnecessary, unneeded damage to the economy and perhaps the labor market.</span>

<span id="sentence-30" data-timestamp="27:07">Kai: Why would it be terrible if you reduce interest rates by, you know, 25 basis points, quarter percentage point, and then the data changes and you have to change your mind? Why is that terrible?</span>

<span id="sentence-31" data-timestamp="27:07">Powell: It wouldn't need to be terrible, and you're right, we always have to be humble that we, the outlook is always much more uncertain than most people think, including us. The economy can and often has recently performed in unexpected ways, so we're ready for that. And if that's what happens, that's what we'll do.</span>

<span id="sentence-32" data-timestamp="27:36">But it's important to get this right. The other thing though is, with the economy, you know, growth is strong right now, the labor market is strong right now, and inflation has been coming down. We can and we will be careful about this decision, because we can be, say more about it, because you can be, you got nothing but time, basically is that what...?</span>

<span id="sentence-33" data-timestamp="27:36">No, the economy is strong. We see very strong growth, we had growth for last year over 3%. Many forecasters see growth coming down to around 2% this year, that that's about what roughly what the first quarter looks like. That means that we don't need to be in a hurry to cut. It means we can wait and become more confident that in fact inflation is coming down to 2% on a sustainable basis.</span>




<p><span id="sentence-34" data-timestamp="28:06" class="neutral">Kai: So this is kind of a subjective question, but then why do you think people are screaming, not for your heads, but close, but for you to cut interest rates so much?</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-35" data-timestamp="28:06" class="dovish bold">Powell: Well, I mean we have, I would say we've divided our critics into sort of equal-sized piles at this point. There are plenty, there's plenty of people who think that, you know, that we shouldn't be cutting now.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">But the point is this - we haven't reduced interest rates. What we've said is we want to be more confident before we take that step.</span> <span class="neutral">And I think I actually think we are, monetary policy is well-placed to react to a range of different paths for the data. And that's really what you want, you want to be in a position where you can react not just to the base case, but if you get a case where inflation progress slows or where the economy weakens, you're also in a position to react to that, and we are.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-36" data-timestamp="29:10" class="neutral">Kai: When you sit around the table at the Fed, or on your Zooms or however you're doing it now, do you have conversations about how your desire to be more confident is received by, yes, the markets and analysts fine, but everybody else?</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-37" data-timestamp="29:10" class="neutral">Powell: So I'd say, yeah, the answer is yes, of course. But the main focus is on getting it right, getting it right is the most important thing by orders of magnitude. If you get it right, then everything else falls into place.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-38" data-timestamp="29:41" class="neutral">So I mean, you're talking about market reaction and things like that, you know, we look at that of course. But ultimately, monetary policy works with a lag, and you want to make the right decisions. And you want the committee to be in a place so that if things work out differently than the base case, you're not out of position. And I, as I said, I think we're in position now where we can handle whatever case comes.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-39" data-timestamp="29:41" class="neutral">Kai: Can we talk briefly about that first cut, which you mentioned, right? That's going to be significant. It came up at your last press conference after the meeting. How important is unanimity to you on that?</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-40" data-timestamp="30:11" class="neutral">Powell: Unanimity as such? So I don't know any Fed chairs who were hoping for dissents. It's not something you want. But at the same time, what, the way I think about it is this - you talk to people, I talk to all the people on the committee before each meeting in depth, and you listen to people, you hear them, you try to get in their thinking and understand, and you try to incorporate that to the maximum extent you can in the decision and the way we talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-41" data-timestamp="30:42" class="neutral">And if you do that, you know, people generally feel they feel consulted, they feel that their views are being considered and reflected, and they may choose to dissent. That happens all the time, it's not a problem when people dissent, it happens, and you know, life goes on.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-42" data-timestamp="30:42" class="neutral">Kai: Do you literally like go knock on their doors or call them on the phone? Like you call Mary or whoever?</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-43" data-timestamp="31:11" class="neutral">Powell: Yes, I have, well I have scheduled calls with every voter and non-voter on the FOMC before every meeting. And not infrequently I'll have another round of calls before that. And not infrequently I will have just calls, I just talk to various people on the committee during that six or seven-week intermeeting period.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-44" data-timestamp="31:11" class="neutral">Kai: Let's talk about the Fed as an institution then for a second, since we're talking about the people and how it all happens. It is, some may argue, one of the significant economic institutions in this government that actually works, right? Congress is a whole different deal, the president is concentrating on his re-election campaign.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-45" data-timestamp="31:42" class="neutral">The Fed as an institution works, and you said to Scott Pelley I think on 60 Minutes, you know, "Integrity is all we have." How mindful are you of the Fed's credibility at a time which is precarious for you?</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-46" data-timestamp="31:42" class="neutral">Powell: So the Fed is, to me, is a very important American institution that serves all Americans on a non-political basis. And what people can expect from us is that we will do our work with painstaking care, we'll understand the theory, we'll understand the data, we'll think about the outlook, and we'll make our decisions based on that and on nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-47" data-timestamp="32:15" class="neutral">We will not be making decisions, particularly about political calendars or anything like that. We'll, all we, you know we don't always get it right, no one does. But that's what we'll do. So integrity is, it is, is everything for ultimately in life, integrity is everything. But for us, integrity is everything because even if, even when we don't get it exactly right, people have to believe, and it's true, that we're doing the absolute best we can in a very transparent way, based on the data, based on our understanding of the economy and the outlook for the economy.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-48" data-timestamp="32:47" class="neutral">It's tremendously important that people understand that about the Fed, and that we're working to serve all Americans, not any particular set of Americans or political parties or leaders.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-49" data-timestamp="32:47" class="neutral">Kai: You've talked previously about humility. You've said the word humble already this morning once. I was talking to Neel Kashkari at the Minneapolis Fed the other day, and he said, you know, this economy is really tough to diagnose, so it's hard for us to know what's going on. Talk to me about humility in the face of, and we were talking about this backstage, about an economy that is still really, really hard to figure out what's going on.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-50" data-timestamp="33:47" class="dovish">Powell: Yeah, the pandemic era has of course been full of surprises. If you go back to the beginning, I think almost all of mainstream macro analysts thought that this, that this was different and that because of the obvious supply-side problems, the collapse of the supply chains and things like that. There was a group who didn't diagnose it that way, but if that's the case, then we thought that our very dynamic economy would recover pretty quickly, that people would go back to work, kids would go back to school, and the economy would be fine and there wouldn't be any much of a need for us to intervene except sort of during that early period to get the economy, you know, keep it from collapsing during the actual intense phase of the pandemic.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-51" data-timestamp="34:45" class="dovish">So that didn't happen, inflation came up, stayed up, and it took a long time to heal. And then it didn't really heal, the supply side didn't really heal in 2022, and we were thinking well, maybe it's not going to heal. And then it did, and you, so the labor force, labor force participation, workers came back into the labor force in 2023. And also the supply chains healed in 2023, so right about the time we were thinking maybe this isn't going to happen, it really happened a lot in 2023, which is part of the story of why the economy did so well last year, was supply-side healing.</span></p> <p><span id="sentence-52" data-timestamp="34:45" class="neutral">So now we have, I mean it just, it's been surprising over and over again. So I think we have to be unusually humble about our ability to foresee the future and be ready for different plausible outcomes.</span></p>
