<span id="sentence-22" data-timestamp="24:06">Kai: 45 minutes, so I'm going to jump right in with the data of the morning. PCE came out this morning, you had it yesterday. 2.8% at the core. Here's my question - you saw it yesterday, what was your first thought?</span>

<span id="sentence-23" data-timestamp="24:36">Powell: My first thought was that the report that came out this morning is pretty much in line with our expectations. So core PCE, as you mentioned, is at 2.8% on a 12-month basis. Headline is at 2.5%. That's what we were expecting, and it's good to see something coming in in line with expectations.</span>

<span id="sentence-24" data-timestamp="25:13">Kai: So as you and your colleagues at the Fed and at the regional banks have been saying, we want more data, more good data. Is this in that bucket?</span>

<span id="sentence-25" data-timestamp="25:13">Powell: Well, let's take a step back. Over the course of the second half of last year, we got what I would definitely consider good data. Over the course of seven months, and then in January of this year, we got a very high reading, much higher reading on inflation. And so February is lower, but it's not as low as most of the good readings we got in the second half of last year. But it's definitely more along the lines of what we want to see.</span>

<span id="sentence-26" data-timestamp="25:43">What we said is that we don't see it as likely to be appropriate that we would begin to reduce interest rates until the committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, is confident that inflation is moving down to 2% on a sustained basis. And what do we need to get that confidence? It's just more good inflation readings like the ones we were getting last year.</span>

<span id="sentence-27" data-timestamp="25:43">Kai: With all possible respect, you all have been saying the same thing for now six months, right? We want more good data. What do you suppose it does to the listening public and to the professionals who are listening to this when you keep saying the same thing?</span>

<span id="sentence-28" data-timestamp="26:14">Powell: So we're steady, our hand is a steady hand in this. We've been saying all through last year and this year that we're making progress. We've noted that progress, we haven't overreacted to it. We didn't overreact to the good data we had in the second half of last year. You heard us saying that this is good, but we need to see more.</span>

<span id="sentence-29" data-timestamp="26:41">And you won't hear us overreacting to these two months that are higher. The reason that's important is that the decision to begin to reduce rates is a very, very important one, because the risks are two-sided. If we reduce rates too soon, there's a chance that inflation would pop back up and we'd have to come back in, and that would be very disruptive, that would not be a good thing for the economy. There's also a risk that we would wait too long, and that that would, you know, in that case it could be unnecessary, unneeded damage to the economy and perhaps the labor market.</span>

<span id="sentence-30" data-timestamp="27:07">Kai: Why would it be terrible if you reduce interest rates by, you know, 25 basis points, quarter percentage point, and then the data changes and you have to change your mind? Why is that terrible?</span>

<span id="sentence-31" data-timestamp="27:07">Powell: It wouldn't need to be terrible, and you're right, we always have to be humble that we, the outlook is always much more uncertain than most people think, including us. The economy can and often has recently performed in unexpected ways, so we're ready for that. And if that's what happens, that's what we'll do.</span>

<span id="sentence-32" data-timestamp="27:36">But it's important to get this right. The other thing though is, with the economy, you know, growth is strong right now, the labor market is strong right now, and inflation has been coming down. We can and we will be careful about this decision, because we can be, say more about it, because you can be, you got nothing but time, basically is that what...?</span>

<span id="sentence-33" data-timestamp="27:36">No, the economy is strong. We see very strong growth, we had growth for last year over 3%. Many forecasters see growth coming down to around 2% this year, that that's about what roughly what the first quarter looks like. That means that we don't need to be in a hurry to cut. It means we can wait and become more confident that in fact inflation is coming down to 2% on a sustainable basis.</span>
