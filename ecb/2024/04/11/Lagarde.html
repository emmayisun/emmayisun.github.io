<h3 id="speech">Speech</h3>

<p>Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB,
Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB
Frankfurt am Main, 11 April 2024</p>

<p>Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.</p>

<p>The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. The incoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Inflation has continued to fall, led by lower food and goods price inflation. Most measures of underlying inflation are easing, wage growth is gradually moderating, and firms are absorbing part of the rise in labour costs in their profits. Financing conditions remain restrictive and our past interest rate increases continue to weigh on demand, which is helping to push down inflation. But domestic price pressures are strong and are keeping services price inflation high.</p>

<p>We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. In any event, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.</p>

<p>The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.</p>

<p>I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.</p>

<h4 id="economic-activity">Economic activity</h4>

<p>The economy remained weak in the first quarter. While spending on services is resilient, manufacturing firms are facing weak demand and production is still subdued, especially in energy-intensive sectors. Surveys point to a gradual recovery over the course of this year, led by services. This recovery is expected to be supported by rising real incomes, resulting from lower inflation, increased wages and improved terms of trade. In addition, the growth of euro area exports should pick up over the coming quarters, as the global economy recovers and spending shifts further towards tradables. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time.</p>

<p>The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the start of the euro. At the same time, the tightness in the labour market continues to gradually decline, with employers posting fewer job vacancies.</p>

<p>Governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures so that disinflation can proceed sustainably. Implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully and without delay will help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis. National fiscal and structural policies should be aimed at making the economy more productive and competitive, which would help to reduce price pressures in the medium term. At the European level, an effective and speedy implementation of the Next Generation EU programme and a strengthening of the Single Market would help foster innovation and increase investment in the green and digital transitions. More determined and concrete efforts to complete the banking union and the capital markets union would help mobilise the massive private investment necessary to achieve this, as the Governing Council stressed in its statement of 7 March 2024.</p>

<h4 id="inflation">Inflation</h4>
<p>Inflation has continued to decline, from an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in February to 2.4 per cent in March, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. Food price inflation dropped to 2.7 per cent in March, from 3.9 per cent in February, while energy price inflation stood at -1.8 per cent in March, after -3.7 per cent in the previous month. Goods price inflation fell again in March, to 1.1 per cent, from 1.6 per cent in February. However, services price inflation remained high in March, at 4.0 per cent.</p>

<p>Most measures of underlying inflation fell further in February, confirming the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures. While domestic inflation remains high, wages and unit profits grew less strongly than anticipated in the last quarter of 2023, but unit labour costs remained high, in part reflecting weak productivity growth. More recent indicators point to further moderation in wage growth.</p>

<p>Inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels in the coming months and to then decline to our target next year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the unfolding effects of our restrictive monetary policy, and the fading impact of the energy crisis and the pandemic. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain broadly stable, with most standing around 2 per cent.</p>

<h4 id="risk-assessment">Risk assessment</h4>
<p>The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects of monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in global trade would also weigh on euro area growth. Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East are major sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could be higher if inflation comes down more quickly than expected and rising real incomes mean that spending increases by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grows more strongly than expected.</p>

<p>Upside risks to inflation include the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages increase by more than expected or profit margins prove more resilient. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly.</p>

<h4 id="financial-and-monetary-conditions">Financial and monetary conditions</h4>
<p>Market interest rates have been broadly stable since our March meeting and wider financing conditions remain restrictive. The average interest rate on business loans edged down to 5.1 per cent in February, from 5.2 per cent in January. Mortgage rates were 3.8 per cent in February, down from 3.9 per cent in January.</p>

<p>Still elevated borrowing rates and associated cutbacks in investment plans led firms to further reduce their demand for loans in the first quarter of 2024, as reported in our latest bank lending survey. Credit standards for loans remained tight, with a further slight tightening for lending to firms and a moderate easing for mortgages.</p>

<p>Against this background, credit dynamics remain weak. Bank lending to firms grew marginally faster in February, at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent, up from 0.2 per cent in January. Growth in loans to households remained unchanged in February, at 0.3 per cent on an annual basis. Broad money – as measured by M3 – grew at a subdued rate of 0.4 per cent in February.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to the ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. In any event, we will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.</p>

<p>In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.</p>

<p>We are now ready to take your questions.</p>

<h3 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h3>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Q: </strong>I heard you loud and clear on confidence needing to increase for restriction to be removed and I also heard you saying that you are not pre-committed to a specific policy path.</span> <span class="neutral">I do want to ask you whether you believe that the levels of confidence that you talk about can be reached by the time you next gather to set policy in June.</span> <span class="neutral">And as a side note to that, I would be interested in knowing whether there were some colleagues around the table today who thought that the time might already have come today.</span>
<span class="neutral">The second question is – and I know that you are going to say we set policy for the eurozone and I appreciate that – but I'm wondering whether the surprisingly hot inflation data out of the US and the reactions it has triggered over the past 24 hours or so have in any way changed the way you think about the ECB's policy path going forward?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Lagarde: </strong> Well, you are asking the first question, but you seem to be covering quite a bit of ground that maybe others wanted to cover as well.</span> <span class="neutral">So I'll try to respond briefly to give others a chance as well to ask similar questions.</span> <span class="neutral">So you heard me loud and clear, indicating that new sentence which is prominent in our monetary policy statement – and I'll read it again – that if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction.</span> <span class="neutral">It's an important sentence because it really describes the mechanics and it better clarifies our reaction function and the process through which we are engaging.</span> <span class="neutral">I have said previously that in April we get some information and some data, and we looked at all that, but in June we know that we will get a lot more data and a lot more information and we will also have new projections, which will incorporate and be informed by all that will be published before the projection is completed.</span> <span class="neutral bold">So we are data dependent.</span> <span class="neutral">We will be looking at all this information, all this data and the projection results that will be produced by the entire Eurosystem, not just the ECB.</span> <span class="neutral">Then we will determine whether all of that confirms our hope that inflation returns to target in a sustained manner, and if as a result, our confidence is sufficiently reinforced.</span> <span class="neutral">That is really the mechanics that we will adopt, that we have resolved to adopt and that we will follow in the coming meetings.</span> <span class="neutral">Now, you asked me whether everybody was exactly on the same page.</span> <span class="neutral">Truth be told, a few members felt sufficiently confident on the basis of the limited data that we received in April and agreed to rally to the consensus of a very large majority of the governors, who were comfortable with the need to reinforce confidence when receiving a lot more data in June.</span> <span class="neutral">Your third question: you asked whether the US CPI number received yesterday had any bearing on the subsequent market development.</span> <span class="neutral">I have said in the past that we are data dependent, we are not Fed dependent.</span> <span class="neutral">Those numbers were not from the Fed, they were from CPI, and obviously anything that happens matters to us and will in due course be embedded in the projection that will be prepared and released in June.</span> <span class="neutral">The United States is a very large market, a very sizeable economy, as well as a major financial centre, so all that finds its way into our projections.</span> <span class="neutral">Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Q: </strong> I have a question referring to the Fed as well, because clearly if the Fed doesn't cut, we'll probably see that in our exchange rate of the euro to the dollar.</span> <span class="neutral">How much is it a concern to you that the euro exchange rate could actually fall to parity or below, and what does it mean for inflation?</span> <span class="neutral">And then did you discuss shrinking the balance sheet a little bit faster than we are and than is currently planned, because clearly it's also a policy tool?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Lagarde: </strong>First of all I would not speculate what other central banks are or are not going to do.</span> <span class="neutral">I think that, as I just responded to the previous questions, consequences in terms of impact on price stability, impact on inflation – whether it is imported inflation or otherwise – all that of course needs to be taken into account and is monitored very carefully and finds its way into our projections.</span> <span class="neutral">So all of that will be included, embedded, monitored and taken into account in our projections.</span> <span class="neutral">But we don't target exchange rates, and we don't comment on exchange rates, and I'm not going to go any further than that.</span> <span class="neutral">I would simply mention that there are multiple channels through which influence can be exercised, it's not just through exchange rates.</span> <span class="neutral">I think there are other channels.</span> <span class="neutral bold">The size of our balance sheet has quite significantly reduced already and I'm sure you have followed that very carefully.</span> <span class="neutral">The entire, very large TLTRO repayment that was coming due in March has been entirely repayed of course and an additional amount over EUR 30 billion has also been added to the repayment.</span> <span class="neutral">In addition to that, given the APP gradual runoff, we also reduce our balance sheet by an average of about EUR 30 billion per month.</span> <span class="neutral">That process is ongoing and will continue to happen as anticipated, as predicted and as determined by the maturity of those bonds that come to runoff, and then we will move to the reduction of the PEPP reinvestment, from the 1st of July until the end of December.</span> <span class="neutral">That's the plan, but there is no further discussion on that.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Q: </strong>Inflation was on the way up in 2021-2022 and a global phenomenon or so it turned out, even though initially the ECB was not expecting it to spread to the eurozone so much -- the ECB projections did not expect inflation to be as high in the eurozone as it was in the US.</span> <span class="neutral">What makes you think that this time around it will be different and the eurozone can diverge from the US, where inflation rates are refusing to fall further?</span> <span class="neutral">And is your confidence regarding the conditions being met in June lower than it was a month ago as you were speaking at the ECB Watchers, or is it intact?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Lagarde: </strong>Thank you for picking up on the Watchers speech – I think the one you are referring to is the one in which I tried to describe as accurately as possible the sequences that we went through: the hiking cycle, the holding cycle and the prospect of the dialing down cycle.</span> <span class="neutral">I think that most, if not all that I have said in that speech still holds to this day.</span> <span class="neutral">And I described, I think in very specific terms, what the confidence level should be and on what basis we're going to nurture that confidence and reinforce it over the course of time in that process.</span> <span class="neutral">So I'm not going to comment on whether I'm more or less confident – I think that what we are saying in the monetary policy statement (MPS) today is that if -- and I'm not going to bore you with repeating it – but if the updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is sustainably at 2% as we anticipate, then it would be appropriate.</span> <span class="neutral">That very much stands and is completely the continuation of the Watchers speech that I gave about 20 days ago.</span> <span class="neutral">You asked me about the distinction that we should or should not draw between euro area inflation and US inflation, and why would we not be entirely US inflation dependent in a way, or US CPI dependent, and should we take our cue.</span> <span class="neutral">We are operating in the euro area with the euro area economy for the benefit of the Europeans.</span> <span class="neutral">Our objective is price stability, and we have to determine our monetary policy decisions on the basis of the data that are produced by the euro area, on the basis of the global environment – and that includes obviously the United States, but it also includes China, which matters, it also includes Japan, which matters, and a lot of emerging market economies that also have a bearing – but we focus predominantly on the territory for which we have responsibility for monetary policy.</span> <span class="neutral">As you know, and as I'm sure all of you in the room know, the nature of inflation in the euro area was different from the nature of inflation in the United States.</span> <span class="neutral">Notably, the drivers of it were different, the fiscal response was different, the consumption by US consumers is of a different nature, investments were different, so I don't think that we can draw conclusions based on an assumption that the two inflations are the same.</span> <span class="neutral">They are not the same.</span> <span class="neutral">The two economies are not the same.</span> <span class="neutral">The political regimes are not the same.</span> <span class="neutral">The fiscal policies are different.</span> <span class="neutral">As a result of that, we have to focus on what we have jurisdiction for, which is the euro area, taking into account what happens in the rest of the world, but not assuming that what happens in the euro area will be the mirror of what happens in the United States.</span> <span class="neutral">We are looking at two different things.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Q:</strong> First, to return to the theme of transatlantic divergence: if this divergence on monetary policy that is expected materialises, does that mean that the ECB is likely to have to ease policy more because of a spillover from tighter financial conditions from the US, or does it mean that you are likely to do less because of foreign exchange markets potentially putting upward pressure on inflation in the euro area?</span> <span class="neutral">Second question is on energy markets: we've seen an increase of roughly 10% in oil prices in recent weeks.</span> <span class="neutral">How big a concern for you is that and and could that derail the potential rate cut in June?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Lagarde: </strong>In many ways you've answered the first question or you at least gave me the elements of my answer to your questions.</span> <span class="neutral bold">We are data dependent.</span> <span class="neutral">We will operate meeting by meeting, and we will take into account all the data that actually matter and how they unfold and develop and affect our economy.</span> <span class="neutral bold">As a result of that I cannot pre-commit to any route, to easing more or easing less, unless and until we have the data and we can analyse the data.</span> <span class="neutral">So that will take its course as the events unfold.</span> <span class="neutral">As I said, I'm not going to speculate on the monetary policy stance and decisions of another central bank.</span>
<span class="neutral">On the energy market: there is one particular segment in the monetary policy statement that I wouldn't want to let go unnoticed because I think it's important, particularly in relation to energy prices, and that's the portion that relates to inflation.</span> <span class="neutral">I'll read it again for you: inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels in the coming months and to then decline to our target next year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the unfolding effect of our restrictive monetary policy, and the fading impact of the energy crisis and the pandemic.</span> <span class="neutral">A lot of those fluctuations that we refer to in that particular paragraph will actually be associated with the very low energy cost that we had in two episodes over the course of 2023.</span> <span class="hawkish">Obviously the price of energy as we see it unfolding in the weeks and months to come will have a bearing related to that base to which prices are compared.</span> <span class="neutral">So declines in inflation, which we have observed so far, are not going to be linear, and we will have fluctuations around the current level, based on our projections, until it declines to our target in mid-2025.</span> <span class="hawkish">And energy prices obviously will matter in that respect.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Q: </strong>I have one question about the ECB not pre-committing to a particular rate path.</span> <span class="neutral">Could we still count on a path of seasons, for example going from a restrictive season to what you said in the past could be the gradual normalisation process?</span> <span class="neutral">And my second question is on TPI, just because maybe there are starting to be some small tensions in the markets as several countries may qualify for excessive deficit procedures.</span> <span class="neutral">What is the impact of this event, if any, on Transmission Protection Instrument eligibility, as the first criterion of this eligibility does mention excessive deficit procedures?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Lagarde: </strong>The ECB is a bank of all seasons, and I don't think that we can be tied to any particular season.</span> <span class="neutral bold">We will be data-dependent, and if the data continue to move in the direction of the disinflationary path that we see, then progress will be continued as well in the path that we adopt.</span> <span class="neutral bold">But this is going to be data-dependent, and that is the reason why we state very clearly in the monetary policy statement that we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.</span> <span class="neutral">The direction is rather clear, but there is no pre-commitment to any particular path and it will all depend on the data that come about.</span> <span class="neutral">On your TPI question, there is a very clear press release that we have posted and that stands, which I'm not going to comment upon yet again.</span> <span class="neutral">But the excessive deficit procedure is one of the four components that we assess when we determine eligibility, and it's an alternative condition that is indicated in that particular segment, which will be taken into account by the Governing Council.</span> <span class="neutral">So, I think you have the answer right there.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Q: </strong>I have one question on budgetary policies.</span> <span class="neutral">As you know, Germany is already pursuing a restrictive budgetary policy, as Italy and for sure France will also have to, given their public deficits are larger than expected.</span> <span class="neutral">Would this situation of restrictive policy offer a reason for the ECB to maybe accelerate future rate cuts?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Lagarde: </strong>On fiscal affairs, I'm going to limit myself to the comments that we included in the monetary policy statement, where we indicate that governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures so that disinflation can proceed sustainably.</span> <span class="neutral">Of course, we then say that implementing the EU's revised economic governance framework fully and without delay will help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis.</span> <span class="neutral">We had the privilege of Valdis Dombrovskis being with us during the Governing Council meeting this morning, and I think all governors were very pleased to hear him confirm that the revised economic governance framework will be put to a vote to the European Parliament before the end of their session, which I think has another two weeks to go.</span> <span class="neutral">So, this is good news to the extent that there will be a framework within which governments are expected to operate and which will be guiding principles and helpful from our monetary policy standpoint.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Q: </strong>Firstly, services inflation is still very sticky.</span> <span class="hawkish bold">It has flatlined for the last five months, and the underlying momentum is now accelerating.</span> <span class="neutral">Would you say that the ECB could theoretically still go ahead with a cut in June if services inflation sticks at around 4%?</span> <span class="neutral">Secondly, can you give us a bit of a colour of the discussion within the Governing Council around the balance of risk surrounding inflation?</span> <span class="neutral">Some of your colleagues have suggested that the balance of risk is now more balanced.</span> <span class="neutral">Where do you stand?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Lagarde: </strong>On your first question, you are right, and I think we point out very clearly in the monetary policy statement that services inflation is still holding at high levels.</span> <span class="hawkish">It has been at 4% for the last five months.</span> <span class="hawkish">Domestic inflation, which comprises a lot of services as well, is at 4.5% and has been there for the last three months, if I recall.</span> <span class="neutral bold">And this is a segment, and those are numbers and indicators, that we're going to monitor very carefully and that we will look at very carefully.</span> <span class="neutral">The momentum is also something that we will be very attentive to.</span> <span class="neutral">But we're not going to wait until everything goes back to 2% to make the decisions that will be necessary in order to make sure that inflation returns to 2% sustainably, at target, in a timely manner.</span> <span class="neutral">It's inevitable that some items will be slightly higher.</span> <span class="neutral">We know that, for instance, if you look at the disaggregation of items, goods have gone down from 1.6% in February to 1.1%.</span> <span class="neutral">So, it's inevitable that some items and some segments will be at higher levels, and we will look at all of them to make our determination and to decide whether on the basis of that assessment we are confident enough.</span> <span class="neutral">That's the first point.</span> <span class="neutral">On the balance of risk, I know one or two governors are keen on this balance of risk concerning inflation, but we've always tried to stay away from that in relation to inflation.</span> <span class="neutral">Historically, we have determined whether it was to the upside, to the downside or broadly balanced in relation to activity, not in relation to inflation.</span> <span class="neutral">And what we prefer to do, as a matter of principle, is identify those components that will bring an upside to the risk and those that will bring a downside to the risk.</span> <span class="neutral">That's what we have done repeatedly in the monetary policy statement.</span> <span class="neutral">We do that yet again, and when you look at the level of uncertainty around, it's probably the right approach to do so in relation to inflation.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Q: </strong>My first question is a follow-up on oil prices.</span> <span class="neutral">How much of an upward concern is that when it comes to inflation going forward?</span> <span class="neutral">And my second question is on the bank lending survey that you mentioned.</span> <span class="neutral">What is your main takeaway from that?</span> <span class="neutral">Is it that there is less demand by companies, or is it more that mortgages and consumer credit have picked up a bit?</span></p>

<p><span class="hawkish"><strong>Lagarde: </strong>On oil prices, they have increased, as was said by one of your colleagues, by roughly 10% in recent weeks, and this is obviously an item which matters a lot.</span> <span class="hawkish">We have learned from the recent shocks that energy costs play a significant role, and we are very attentive to those evolutions.</span> <span class="neutral">We are largely informing our assessment on the basis of futures.</span> <span class="neutral">So we look at how futures evolve as well.</span> <span class="neutral">It's not just the price of the barrel of Brent that we look at.</span> <span class="neutral">We also try to anticipate as much as possible.</span> <span class="neutral">It's not perfect, but we try to use futures as an indicator of where the markets are seeing prices of oil for the future.</span> <span class="neutral">On your second question, the bank lending survey is always informative, but it's a survey.</span> <span class="neutral">It indicates what the banks assess, assume and expect from their customers – both corporate customers and households, or people.</span> <span class="neutral">Predominantly mortgages and a bit on consumption, but predominantly mortgages.</span> <span class="neutral">So we have that.</span> <span class="neutral">And we also have the hard data, which is interest rates that are offered to those customers, and the volume of loans on an annual basis.</span> <span class="neutral">So, if you only look at the bank lending survey, what you see is the anticipation by banks that demand will be slightly lower on the corporate side while it will be slightly higher on the household side.</span> <span class="neutral">If you look at volume, there is a slight – not a major – uptick in the volume of loans to corporates and a slight – stable compared with the last month – uptick in the volume of loans offered to households.</span> <span class="dovish">And as a final point, on both corporate loans and loans to households we have a slight decline in the interest rate that is offered to borrowers.</span> <span class="dovish">So, you can deduct from that that the financial sector is expecting that financing costs are likely to be smaller in the future.</span> <span class="neutral">It's the beginning.</span> <span class="neutral">In many of those numbers and data indicators that we have, we see positive developments, but it's the beginning of developments.</span> <span class="neutral bold">As I said earlier, we want to reinforce that confidence that things are going in the right direction, both in terms of growth but more importantly in terms of inflation decline.</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Q: </strong>I would like to know what fluctuations on the current inflation number could be tolerated if they come from supply shocks and not from demand maybe going again above 3%.</span> <span class="neutral">As you have just mentioned, the last inflation spike started as a supply shock.</span> <span class="neutral">Secondly, public deficit spreads are as tight as I can remember.</span> <span class="neutral">Are you glad that you could deliver your restrictive monetary policy without creating big tensions, or do you fear that this will incentivise deficits?</span></p>

<p><span class="neutral"><strong>Lagarde: </strong>On your first question, we know that there will be fluctuation.</span> <span class="neutral">That's the reason why we put it in the monetary policy statement.</span> <span class="neutral">We know that there's not going to be a linear decline of inflation over the course of the next months or quarter.</span> <span class="neutral">But what our projections are telling us is that we will have those bumps on the road, if you will, but we will reach the target in mid-2025, so a return to 2% in mid-2025.</span> <span class="neutral">Between now and 2025, there will be ups and downs.</span> <span class="neutral">And, as I said, a lot of that is related to the base effects that result from the two significant changes in energy prices in the course of 2023.</span> <span class="neutral">How much can we tolerate?</span> <span class="neutral">I think what is really important is the data.</span> <span class="neutral">It's the overall data.</span> <span class="neutral">It's the projection.</span> <span class="neutral">We have embedded in our projection of last March those bumps on the road.</span> <span class="neutral">They are in there.</span> <span class="neutral">They are in the baseline.</span> <span class="neutral">What we need to see is how far away from those bumps embedded in the baseline we are likely to go if we are facing supply shocks, as you suggested.</span> <span class="neutral">But bumps will be there.</span> <span class="neutral">It will not be linear.</span> <span class="neutral">Bumps are embedded in the projection of March.</span> <span class="neutral">We will take stock of that in June as well and update our projections at that point in time.</span> <span class="neutral">On your second question, without being triumphant and without celebrating anything yet, what we are observing is a decline in inflation and a disinflationary process that is in progress and that is comforting us that the monetary policy that we have adopted so far has contributed significantly to this.</span> <span class="neutral">And we will continue to operate on the basis of the three criteria that I have mentioned several times, which are in the monetary policy statement: being particularly attentive to wages and the evolution of wages, which constitute a large contributor to services; paying close attention to profits, to make sure that unit profits actually absorb as much as possible of the wage increases; and continuing to be very attentive to productivity, which is also something that we expect will improve in the course of 2024.</span></p>
