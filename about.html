<h2>About</h2>

<p>
“Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”

'Fedbot' represents the rebirth of my journey in learning about markets. Currently, the goal of this project is to reproduce old workflows using public data and open-source projects. The site is not intended to provide information, tools, or advice to its readers, although these functions might be included at a later stage.<br>Given the circumstances, my insights into the markets may not always be accurate and site materials may not always be up-to-date. For any mistakes or inaccuracies, please contact the email provided below.
