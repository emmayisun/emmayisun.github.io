| Money Market Fund Repo and the ON RRP Facility | **The regression results show three key points:**<br>- Having MMFs that are ON RRP counterparties boosts the private repo rates that a fund family receives. After controlling for fixed effects, our results suggest a one standard deviation increase in RCP share leads to a 2.5% or greater decrease in the share of repo occurring below the ON RRP rate. Meanwhile, a one standard deviation increase in the share of omnibus accounts leads to an 0.6% decrease in the share of repo below the ON RRP rate.<br>- More valuable fund-dealer relationships, as measured by dealer share – the relative importance of a fund's lending to a dealer in 2019 leads to more lending at sub-ON RRP rates, so long as dealer-specific effects are controlled for as in our second and third specifications. In these two specifications, a one standard deviation increase in a fund's share in total dealer repo leads to a roughly 0.3% increase in repo occurring below the ON RRP rate.<br>- Concerns about managing late-day flows, as proxied by greater flow volatility, also leads to more lending at sub-ON RRP rates. A one standard deviation increase in flow volatility leads to a 0.4% increase in repo occurring below the ON RRP rate.| [Link](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/money-market-fund-repo-and-the-on-rrp-facility-20231215.html) |
